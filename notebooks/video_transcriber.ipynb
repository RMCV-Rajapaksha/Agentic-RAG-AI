            "4. Let's say that if I ask you a question in an interview when should we probably go ahead and use langraph or what is the differences between lang and lang graph what would you probably try to explain just write down in the comment section before seeing the specific video and then after you write down the comment right just go through this entire video and then try to see that how many things that I've actually told does it matches with all the information that you have right so please make sure to do that but in this video we are going to have a detailed discussion between lang chain versus lang graph.\n",
            "\n",

            "6. Now uh if I talk about lang chain you know and I hope it is one of the most popular framework which is basically used to create generative AI application.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. So first of all we will just go ahead and talk about langchain.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. So let's go ahead and write it down over here like langchain.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. Now if I talk about langchain in lang chain obviously this is this langchain is basically used to create if I probably say it is used to create llm powered application llm powered chatbot assistant it can be it can be an application or generative AI application okay now when I say LLM powered that basically means anything that you create whether you create a chatbot Whether you create a simple app or whether you create any kind of application right at the end of the day you are specifically using LLMs right on top of this LLMs there are multiple things that can be used here you can use prompts along with the LLMs you can use tools you can use different kind of integrations and many more things so overall if I probably talk about lang chain Any application that is basically developed in Langchain, a generative AI application or LLM powered application or a AI chatbot assistant.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. There are three main important steps that happens in Langchain.\n",
            "\n",
            "11. This is my one step.\n",
            "\n",
            "12. This is my another step and this is my third step.\n",
            "\n",
            "13. Okay.\n",
            "\n",
            "14. So these are the three main components.\n",
            "\n",
            "15. Now what are these specific components? When I say steps, I'm basically talking about components.\n",
            "\n",
            "16. The first component is nothing but it is basically called as retrieve.\n",
            "\n",
            "17. Okay.\n",
            "\n",
            "18. So here we are basically going to write it as retrieve.\n",
            "\n",
            "19. Retrieve or retriever.\n",
            "\n",
            "20. Then the second important component is nothing but summarize.\n",
            "\n",
            "21. And the third important component is nothing but your final answer or output.\n",
            "\n",
            "22. Okay.\n",
            "\n",
            "23. Now when we talk about this components.\n",
            "\n",
            "24. Okay.\n",
            "\n",
            "25. So here I will just go ahead and write output.\n",
            "\n",
            "26. Okay.\n",
            "\n",
            "27. When we talk about the specific components in lang chain whether you generate any kind of generative AI applications empowered application or AI assistant these three components will be definitely there.\n",
            "\n",
            "28. Now the question rises kish what does exactly happen in the directory in retrieve? There are three main important things that we basically do.\n",
            "\n",
            "29. One is data injection.\n",
            "\n",
            "30. Now the question rises what is data injection? Data injection is very simple, right? We ingest a data right we probably load a data from a specific source.\n",
            "\n",
            "31. Now the main thing is that here the source can be different different it can be a PDF file.\n",
            "\n",
            "32. It can be an external database.\n",
            "\n",
            "33. It can be an excel file.\n",
            "\n",
            "34. It can be a website.\n",
            "\n",
            "35. You need to probably web scrap the data.\n",
            "\n",
            "36. There may be various different ways right in data injection.\n",
            "\n",
            "37. So when we talk about data injection this is also called as we basically use something called as document loader over here right.\n",
            "\n",
            "38. So we use nothing but document loader.\n",
            "\n",
            "39. So in langchain you have a specific class uh where you have lot of packages and integration specifically with respect to document loader.\n",
            "\n",
            "40. Here the main aim is that you try to load documents from different different sources.\n",
            "\n",
            "41. It can be any source.\n",
            "\n",
            "42. It can be a PDF file.\n",
            "\n",
            "43. It can be a excel file.\n",
            "\n",
            "44. It can be a CSV file.\n",
            "\n",
            "45. It can even be some third-party APIs like Wikipedia.\n",
            "\n",
            "46. It can be r.\n",
            "\n",
            "47. It can be anything as such.\n",
            "\n",
            "48. Right? So they are multiple sources and langen has a huge amount of different different kind of integrations already provided in terms of document loader.\n",
            "\n",
            "49. And what I feel is that whenever you try to develop any of this kind of application, this is the most important step because here the parsing of the data will happen, right? The parsing of the data will happen.\n",
            "\n",
            "50. The more in a like when you do the parsing, if you do this much more accurately, then you will definitely be able to generate uh or create a generative AI application with much more accuracy.\n",
            "\n",
            "51. So now there are dedicated companies who specifically do this particular task who create this kind of packages with respect to document loader right I need to probably I create a document loader to let's say web scrap the data from the internet which will be a very important use case for most of the use case that we specifically implement in the industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "52. So in document loader this basically happens right and that is a part of data ingestion.\n",
            "\n",
            "53. Now coming to the second most important component.\n",
            "\n",
            "54. The second most important component is nothing but it is called as text splitter.\n",
            "\n",
            "55. Now text splitter is also a separate class that is available in lang chain or a separate package wherein there are multiple ways of splitting the text.\n",
            "\n",
            "56. Once you read the data from all these kind of sources, right? We I cannot just directly provide the entire data to my LLM model as a context.\n",
            "\n",
            "57. Right? So what I have to do why I cannot provide because there is a very important component which is called as context window.\n",
            "\n",
            "58. Every LLM has a limitation with respect to the context window.\n",
            "\n",
            "59. So in order to overcome this what we do is that once we read the data from this data source we try to divide this data into smaller chunks into smaller chunks.\n",
            "\n",
            "60. Smaller chunks smaller chunks.\n",
            "\n",
            "61. Once we divide this data into smaller chunk then the next step because after we divide this we need to store it somewhere right and that is where your third important component comes is nothing but vector databases.\n",
            "\n",
            "62. Now inside this vector databases when we are specifically using vector databases here we also use something called as vector embeddings.\n",
            "\n",
            "63. Now for vector embeddings it is nothing but we are converting the text into vectors that is the main aim with respect to vector embeddings right.\n",
            "\n",
            "64. So this is a kind of a task wherein we convert the text into vectors.\n",
            "\n",
            "65. So once it is basically converted we basically store that into the vector database.\n",
            "\n",
            "66. Now the question arises why do we store it right because at the end of the day from my any application if all my data is basically stored in a vector database we will definitely be able to do different different kind of search.\n",
            "\n",
            "67. One search example is nothing but semantic search.\n",
            "\n",
            "68. It can be graph DB search right and with the help of this search we will be able to retrieve the right amount of context and give it to our LLM to finally generate the output right and that is really important right unless and until this is not done accurately and we don't get the right kind of context out of the directed database we will not be able to accurately give the output to the user right so in the retrieve component of lang chain you really need to be good at all the specific things when you go tomorrow to any companies to gen and if you're probably generating or developing a generative AI powered application you will be doing all the specific steps you need to parse the data you need to probably store the data in exact right format with respect to the document data type you need to make sure that you have to do this kind of chunking strategy so that you try to solve this context window size with respect to different different LLMs that you're using and finally you store all this particular data into the vector database.\n",
            "\n",
            "69. Okay.\n",
            "\n",
            "70. Now coming to the next important step after we probably complete this retrieve component.\n",
            "\n",
            "71. It is nothing but summarize.\n",
            "\n",
            "72. Now here is where you know and when we talk about summarize or when we talk about building generative AI applications uh with the help of lang chain here you specifically follow a sequential order.\n",
            "\n",
            "73. Okay, this is really important to understand and here you will definitely be understanding the differences between langin and lang graph.\n",
            "\n",
            "74. When we talk about sequential order, now what does this basically mean? In sequential order here, it basically means that the execution of any task will just happen sequentially.\n",
            "\n",
            "75. We cannot go back.\n",
            "\n",
            "76. Okay.\n",
            "\n",
            "77. So this entire langen the generative AI application that is developed with the help of langchen follows a DAG graph right directed a cyclic graph okay that basically means if my execution is basically started from this task it has to probably go to this task it has to go to this particular task only sequential I cannot come back this option is not there this option is not there right so when we talk about this summarize component here you'll be able to see that we create some kind of chaining concept.\n",
            "\n",
            "78. So in lang chain whenever a generative AI application is basically developed here we try to implement this chaining concept.\n",
            "\n",
            "79. Now in the chaining concept we first of all go ahead and write our prompt chain.\n",
            "\n",
            "80. So let's say this is my prompt chain right sorry this is my prompt.\n",
            "\n",
            "81. We basically go ahead and give a prompt.\n",
            "\n",
            "82. prompt is just like an instruction to an LLM right along with this we try to integrate this uh prompt with our LLM.\n",
            "\n",
            "83. So LLM will be my second thing in the chain right second important component in the chain and then the third important component can be my context the context that I'm supplying to the LLM.\n",
            "\n",
            "84. So this will basically be my prompt.\n",
            "\n",
            "85. This will be my llm and this will basically be my context and this context will be coming from the specific vector database.\n",
            "\n",
            "86. So internally you'll be able to see that this vector database will be comp connected to this particular chain itself wherein we will be providing the context and this execution takes place sequentially one after the other right and finally whatever output you basically get here we are basically going to use or here we are going to give the answer of the output here again we can use multiple components one component can be my memory right so here we can use some kind of persistent memory.\n",
            "\n",
            "87. So if you have been seeing my videos with respect to lang lang chain or lang lang graph I have covered all this specific thing right and next thing after this persisting memory I can also go ahead and probably combine prompt with a separate LLM over here prompt with a separate LLM over here so that we will be able to get the output right and finally here you can actually see that finally we generate this specific output so this can also be created in the form of chain but understand one thing everything is basically getting executed sequentially.\n",
            "\n",
            "88. This is the most important thing in the entire lang chain with respect to developing any generative AI powered applications.\n",
            "\n",
            "89. Okay.\n",
            "\n",
            "90. So here is what we basically do with the help of lang chain right and again I will again talk about the differences as we go ahead like what are the main exact differences and all here you saw that it is following a sequential order.\n",
            "\n",
            "91. It follows a directed earth cyclic graph.\n",
            "\n",
            "92. You know, uh here everything is in the form of chaining.\n",
            "\n",
            "93. Here we have these three important components.\n",
            "\n",
            "94. How each and every component is basically executed and how it proceeds to finally getting an output.\n",
            "\n",
            "95. Right? Now, similarly, if I talk about langraph, okay, langraph.\n",
            "\n",
            "96. Now when I talk about langraph here the main aim is basically to create stateful multi- AI agentic application agentic application or AI agents multi-state stateful multiAI agents itself right now here the main aim if I just want to probably break this down here you'll be able ble to see that we create AI agents and it's not like a simple a single AI agent it'll be multiple AI agents which will be doing separately different task and the best part about these AI agents is that they can communicate with each other to solve a complex workflow complex workflow I've already started my entire langraph playlist and I think if you're following them I've explained this entirely in a much more detailed manner uh you know in the live classes uh that I've actually taken in my YouTube channel right now here the main thing is that it need not be directed or cyclic graph it it even need not be sequential this can follow in a different ways okay so first of all we'll talk about what are the important components in lang graph okay some of the important components in lang graph are like tasks second important component we basically use as nodes third it'll be something called as edges.\n",
            "\n",
            "97. Fourth is nothing but graph.\n",
            "\n",
            "98. So that basically means my entire lang graph the complex workflows that is defined which will be it it'll be in the form of a graph and when you see a graph right if you probably have some knowledge about graph let's say uh here I will just go ahead and write this is my task A okay this is my task A right so let's say this is my task A this can be my task B this can be my task C this can be my task E and this can be my final task that is end let's say now each and every task over here so let's say if this is my task A this is my task B this is my task C this is my task D so when we talk about this kind of task we basically start from start over here there will be a conditional edge then we go to task D then finally we go to Now here also I'm showing sequential only but one important thing is that you can go back from task B to task A you can go back to task D to task C you can reexecute this and here you can come so that is the reason why I'm saying that this two important thing is basically happening that is communication within this particular task and each and every task is executed by a separate AI agent you can basically create a separate AI agent and perform that task similarly and the output of one task can be passed to the output of the other task.\n",
            "\n",
            "99. It can also be vice versa.\n",
            "\n",
            "100. Right? So here a feedback mechanism can also be generated and even human feedback mechanism can also be included.\n",
            "\n",
            "101. So this way you are able to solve a very complex workflow.\n",
            "\n",
            "102. In my recent uh live session, I gave a hackathon wherein you have to probably implement the entire software development life cycle with the help of human feedback with with the help of this entire complex workflow.\n",
            "\n",
            "103. So what is software development life cycle? First requirement gathering, then business understanding, then documentation, then code creation, then unit testing, then managers probably reviewing the sorry code peers reviewing the code review, providing the feedback, quality check, all those kind of check and finally implementing the entire software development life cycle and people implement it in a much more beautiful way.\n",
            "\n",
            "104. So here if you probably see we follow entire graph structure and this graph structure need not be a directed or cyclic graph because here my task can go from up and down it can go here and there right.\n",
            "\n",
            "105. So if you see some of the important differences with respect to the component here we use components like prompt lm context we use data injection we use persistent memory right here we specifically use nodes edges so these are nothing but these are nodes right these are edges edges is basically used for flow of the information and when I say stateful here the persistent memory is quite more efficient ient and the best part about this is that the memory is basically shared between each and every task any update that I'm doing in one variable this all nodes will be able to access those variables and the persistent memory is quite efficient in langraph right so if I talk about agentic AI application you may use some of the components that are available in the lang chain but at the end of the day you are building an amazing agentic application with the help of langraph Right.\n",
            "\n",
            "106. Other than that there are some more differences which you can probably find out over here.\n",
            "\n",
            "107. So these are some of the important components.\n",
            "\n",
            "108. As I said with respect to persistent memory this is much more sufficient efficient.\n",
            "\n",
            "109. Here we just use a sequential order.\n",
            "\n",
            "110. Here it need not be a sequential order to solve any kind of use cases.\n",
            "\n",
            "111. Right? And here we also understood what are the important components and here what are the important components.\n",
            "\n",
            "112. Right? Now the reason of making this specific video is to make your understanding very very strong.\n",
            "\n",
            "113. If I ask you a question, hey, when should we probably go ahead and use fine-tuning or when should we use rag or when should we probably go ahead and use uh let's say prompt engineering many people are not able to clearly say the differences right if this is the kind of question I have already made this kind of videos this videos like see in the companies now many people more than 80 to 90%age of the people uh in the companies are implementing efficient rag systems so here also you'll be able to see that when we create these are like traditional rags okay I'll also talk about traditional rag and agentic rag so in the traditional rag you basically create an llm right this let's say this is my llm powered ai application this will be interacting with my rag database right so this will basically be my rag database and this rag database will provide the context to the lm to finally provide the output right here if my input is basically going on So this is what is basically happening in a traditional rag.\n",
            "\n",
            "114. In the case of agentic rag, we create agents.\n",
            "\n",
            "115. We create AI agents and this agent is responsible whether I have to make a call to my database, whether I have to make the call to my tools or whether I have to take any kind of other action.\n",
            "\n",
            "116. Automatically this AI agents will be able to take that particular decision and provide me the response.\n",
            "\n",
            "117. And then probably let's say that after getting this information I need to go ahead and hit the tool and provide the get the response.\n",
            "\n",
            "118. This entire thing is basically implemented in the form of a workflow.\n",
            "\n",
            "119. Right? So this is how things basically happen.\n",
            "\n",
            "120. I'm soon going to make a detailed video on different types of rag which is one of the most important component that is currently required right now.\n",
            "\n",
            "121. Right? So I hope you like this particular video and uh this was the basic differences between langin and langraph.\n",
            "\n",
            "122. In the upcoming videos I'm also going to discuss about other frameworks.\n",
            "\n",
            "123. let's say crew AI agno and I'm going to probably go ahead and explain you all the specific things and these all things we detail explain in our live batches all the information will be given in the description of this particular video you can go ahead and check it out so yes uh this was it for my side I'll see you in the next video have a great day thank you and all take care bye-bye.\n",

            "Yeah. So before uh go through the session so let's try to understand like what we are trying to cover today. So the topic was like building agents applications and tools. But why we need to build a applications? So we have to first need to establish a motivation for that. Right? So why we need to build? So we are trying to do AI transformation and we will discuss like discuss what is AI transformation and also we'll take example and business example and try to use that and say how we can do the AI transformation step by step with that business use case and then Anjen will basically bring in a W integrator to save us all because when we want to implement that in real life we need the toolkit to develop that right so and then we we basically demonstrated and how we do the transformation using W indicator so this going to be the story I I don't want to reveal a lot of stuff that's why I kept it brief in brief but now let's try to understand what is the transformation I mean this is like a I mean this it's not like well adapted term but it's there already and people are discussing about is so the basic idea is now you have a lot of business operations you have lot of things that happening in your organization now can you use AI and enhance those operations so you'll have more productivity more efficiency or a better user experience and also it can be like unlocking new capabilities that wasn't possible before and why AI is important in this scenario because AI is actually uh has become a very powerful tool with the generative AI right so now we can build a lot of stuff that we couldn't build before in previously we couldn't even do a chatbot usually unless we have like a lot of rule based uh or knowledge based kind of systems now building a chatbot is just a matter of like writing a prompt connecting to LLM just have a subscription just need to have like $5 and still you can build a chatbot and try it out you don't even need like a lot of money and why now and that's all because of that because we have a lot of opportunities now the new capabilities are there so you have to basically make use of that and basically uh transform your business with AI otherwise others will do that and you will end up losing the race because there is a race now happening because everybody's trying to use AI so they can transform their business into a better business better uh operation And that's why we need it. It's not a choice of course, right? Because we have to catch up. I mean, even if you don't want to do it, still you'll have to do it to catch up with others otherwise you can't survive. And then of course how we can do it right. So which we will actually discuss step by step during this session. So to actually go through this session, we will introduce this business scenario which we call as AI sorry O2 travels there's actually a business or a platform that help customers to plan their uh vacations or their trips right and then do the reservations like for example the hotel reservations. So with this uh platform currently customers can do the hotel discovery and also they can do the availability of the hotels or the rooms real time and also do a reservation and again basically do I mean write or read reviews so they can get understanding of what they want to basically reserve. So they can do these functionalities and I think you all are familiar with this. If you have used like booking.com those kind of a platform this is what actually they do right and this is going to be the user experience you have a static web page where you can basically explore and add certain filters and basically get whatever the available hotels and this is going to be the experience right so this is what we we usually have and this is going to be the architecture we are going to have in our business. We have a hotel API, search API, booking API, review API and all these APIs are connecting to our internal databases where we have the hotel database and we have uh booking database which will connected to the booking API and also we have bunch of portals that we expose these capabilities to the customers. For examples, we have the hotel owners who will try to register their hotels. So they will connect to the registration portal and that will go through the hotel API and basically we will have that in our DB then and actually the customers who want to plan their trip book their trip if they want to come and basically do that operation then they have the booking portal they'll use that right so this is actually a business scenario we have already I mean familiar with right so this is what we have right now and this is going to be our system and now we have to think how we can apply a transformation information on top of this existing business APIs and of course we shouldn't forget about the data because data is our strategic asset right that's the asset actually so whatever you have for example you have the booking history of our customers and we have the search behaviors we have their reviews all those things we have already in our hand right so we have to make use of that that's a assist we have and also we have other information like the hotel information trends happening seasonal pattern also some external data maybe the weather events happening all those stuff right so those are also very important information that we can make use of when we are building this kind of I mean I didn't say what's we are going to build but it's going to be useful right if we have to think of how we can make use of this information because we have AI capabilities that can do that now now let's discuss like how we can actually do the a transformation information. So before moving to the code, we will try to come with a vision that we want to implement because we we can't just directly jump to the code, right? That's not the process. So we have to come up with a vision where we want to reach. So where we want to reach now with this business is we need to have a intelligent interactive experience that we can give to the users. So they can go and do a trip planning. they can basically say this is my budget, this is what I want and this is going to be my uh basically uh the activities that I'm looking for. So those kind of things they can say to the system and they can get a good uh trip uh plan and then they can basically do the uh reservations or bookings following that plan. So that kind of experience and also we have this strategy data I mentioned them earlier. So we want to make use of them and then basically give a better experience to our customers. For example, if you know about their uh booking patterns or what they like, we can make good sessions to them, right? That's what actually we are doing in our WA application as well. We make use of what you what your interest are and when we are trying to use that to give session sessions so you know which sessions that you can attend in your mobile application. And now the key question we can ask here is can we achieve this transformation without touching the business APIs. So of course there are two ways. One way is you go and basically throw away all the APIs you have and then come up with a set of uh system I mean APIs or system whatever integrations and then consider that as your new experience but that's too risky because we are still in a domain that there are a lot of unknowns there are a lot of possibilities we don't want to just throw away what we have right now we want to keep it there because even customers are in a transition period we don't know whe the customers will like the I mean if we have a chat experience. We don't know whether they will like it, right? They don't like it. They don't they want the old portal. So, we don't want to throw away that. We don't want to throw away the existing business. Going to keep it as it is. But on top of that, can we bring our new capabilities? So, that's a good question to ask if we actually doing a transformation and we will kind of showcase like what will be the uh end product look like. I think Anja can basically take us through the demo. So we already have a website set up for that and of course we are logged in so we know who you are in this setting and this is the current flow we have right now and we want to improve that and there is a AI assistant uh tab on the top. So that's where actually we will give the new experience to our users. So let's go there and here it will basically explain like what are the capabilities that is available to you because we can't just give a chat and say okay do figure it out right so it will give some information and then they can start chatting I think we have to start the backend right yeah okay so this is the agent that we have built and so that should happen behind the scenes but we starting it now and once we have it we can try out the capabilities and see like what would the experience would look like actually okay we have the chat experience so let's ask something like plan a trip sorry yeah I'm not sure the everybody can see can we maybe zoom it no Show me. Show zoom it more. Zoom it. Zoom it. I think it's okay. Okay. I know like now the UX is like messed up but we have to do it for the visibility. Sorry. So let's ask this. So you're asking like plan me a trip to Sri Lanka Friday trip and we don't I think it's Friday, right? So we don't give any other information like what I like because I expect the system to know about those stuff. Now can we just zoom in a little bit because we can see what we have the top. So here in the top it say uh here we have the 5day trip itinary for you and it's tailored for your preference. The so the guy whoever basically asking this question he has already booked like lot of eco-friendly hotels in the past and he has basically uh uh booked hotel around hiking places. So he we know in the system we know he love hiking he love nature. So we have seen that in his reviews in his booking patterns. So we know those stuff and that information has been fed to the system and now basically it says okay this is tailored for your eco-friendly preferences and law for nature adventure and that's how basically the the system is suggesting us these recommendations like these are the hotels that you can visit and these are the places that you should visit around these hotels. I think another thing we can do is we can ask like a hotel specific question, right? Or we can try to book a hotel. But let's try to book a hotel. Yeah. So let's agree with this plan and say okay go ahead and uh do the booking. And this is like a kind of a critical operation. Ideally agent shouldn't do it without any consent or authorization. But now we are doing it because in this session we are not covering that part. But that will be covered in the next session. So in next session uh our speakers will show how we can actually uh manage these kind of scenarios and get the uh I mean user authorize so that agent will not do uh things that are unwanted. So it has I think proceed with it right I don't see actually the responses here I'm sure the audience can see also. So it's giving us the confirmation number. So it has done I mean go ahead with the booking and it has booked two or three hotels. Two hotels right? So and this is the experience and also another thing we can try out is we can ask a hotel specific question. I mean in our portal we can't do that. If you want to do that even with booking.com if you want to ask a hotel specific question you have to go through this contact hotel forum right? So you have to it's like the contact us. So you have to ask that question and then wait until the hotel agent or whoever I mean the human representative from that end reach you back. So that's the usual process but we don't want to do that anymore. We want to a be able the AI to be able to answer those question without any wait in time. So we can ask some question. I'm not okay. What I'll ask about the pet policy. Okay. We we'll ask about the pet policy for a given hotel one of the hotels. That's good. Okay, now it's giving us answers saying, \"Okay, Knuckles wideness lodge. They allow pets, small dogs and cats up to 7 kilos.\" Okay, you have to wait your dog before you're going. And the eyes are clean if you Okay. Yeah. So, of course, so they allow it. So, we are good to go then, right? Okay. Now uh so we look at like what's the experience or what's the vision that we have now, right? So, now what we need to look at is how we how we can achieve that vision because we know where we want to go but we need to figure out how we can reach there. So yes, so we look at the power uh tip planner and that was capable doing natural conversations, booking uh trips and also mass assistance to basically understand your preferences even without giving that information and also you were able to ask hotel specific questions. Now there are set of architecture considerations right first to build this kind of experience what we need do we need a venya workflow do we need a retrieval augmented generation if you uh attended the previous session we discussed about this concept in detail or do we need a agent so we have to ask these questions and what are the right questions to ask to figure this out because this is very important you can't I mean if you figure this you don't figure this out and do something it's going to be costly for you to roll back. So let's think okay can we use a genera integration here because what we said in our previous session whenever possible you have to use gena integrations don't go to the agent because agent will introduce a lot of other problems so of course if you give this kind of uh question like I want to plan a fiveday trip Jenna can basically understand the request and also generate a useful response saying okay great based on your preferences if we have given the preferences This is what I can recommend and that's based on whatever the information given to the model or whatever the model knows and that's the all what it can do. It can't go beyond that. It can't get the hotel availability real time if we haven't provided that information. I mean we can't give the hotel availability for all the hotel to the prompt right that's not practical. We can't I mean that general integration cannot actually do actual booking. We just can answer questions but it can't do that operation and also uh the personalization across the session won't happen also because now this gen uh integration it may have access to what we have provided as the person session information but that's it right it can't remember you the agent can remember you but this gender integration it can't and that's why we need AI agent for this scenario IO and because we have to listen and act dynamically, we also have to connect to business APIs like the booking uh API and also we have to leverage the personalization. So we have to basically get autonomous uh system right to do these things. So that's why we need AI agent. I think I don't think like it's very uh difficult to determine but I just wanted to go through the process so we can follow that process when you are designing I mean designing other applications as well. So the argue would look like this. So we have the uh core business APIs again they in the yellow search API booking API and view API and then we have the tip plan agent which we are planning to build and it has to be connected to some user personalization data which we need to have somehow and also it has to connect to the contact hotel and we will I mean because it has to get the hotel specific questions answer to the hotel specific questions and right now if If you connect it to the contact hotel that means still the agent will have to wait for the human representative to answer back to the contact hotel forum right in this scenario. Let's sort it out step by step. So we have two components now the user personalization data and the contact hotel forum. So those are the things that we are having a bit of a trouble now because we don't know where the user personalization data comes because we have row data but we don't have personalization data yet and also we don't want agent to wait until the hotel representative answers and that means like agent will have to wait and the user will have to wait so it's not going to solve the problem again so we have to basically do something for that as well so we have to use AI so we have two components so let's first try to figure out like how we can do the personalization So in that case now we have this strategic data for example I explained earlier we have the booking history we have the search behaviors we also have the reviews right so we have all those information and now can we use that information with generative AI and transform that information into some personalization reports personalization profiles that are actually useful to build this scenario and technical really okay so the other question we could ask is now earlier case we decided like we are going to use AI agent right so can you use AI agent here also I mean do we need a agent really technically I mean we can use AI agent but we don't know we so we don't want it it's a overkill in this scenario actually we know what we have to build we know the workflow so we can do a simple integration without a agent we can figure it out so the ideal pattern we would require in this scenario is a generative workflow and how we would build that is it's very simple we will talk to our admin APIs because we can't talk to the users I mean the whatever the APIs that are used by the user portal that API is authorized by the users token right so user has to basically give authorization to use those APIs but we have admin portal that can be used by the admins to basic basically look at the uh reviews or a booking history for a certain user given the user's ID or something and we can use that API and fetch all the booking history and the reviews given by that user and then use a geni workflow in the middle that means that basically you use that information in the generative prompt and then do a generation of a user profile and And that's simple as it is. And then you just have to push that to the uh our database and that profile will look like something like this. So it will have like these are Jones activity report and he likes the warm weather, he likes hiking, rock climbing, he likes hotels that have crowfriendly uh gym capabilities all those stuff and also he doesn't like uh red meat. So all those preferences that we taken from his previous booking experiences. Okay. Now when we have the personalization our system argued to this right. So we have the trip plan agent and that try to get the personalization information from the database and before that is accessing the database we need to have this activity analyzer to basically populate the database with all user uh personalization profiles. Now we are left with the contact us. So how we can solve that problem now? So now we have to think rethink what we should do with the contact hotel forum. So today's problem is like basically I explained it earlier user has to uh contact the hotel and then hotel staff will have to basically manually reply back and that's this is not even our internal staff right this is the hotel staff so we are not the hotel we are basically the booking.com and we we can't do anything to help there until they reply back. So the future vision is like we want a assistant to basically answer this on behalf of the hotel staff and that means users will be more happy because they will get uh I mean real time or near realtime answers and also more consistent responses and how to do this now that's the I think more most important question so to do that I think we can see the pattern clearly now because we have discussed we have been discussing this pattern is so we see that we have a lot of data like documents, PDF, websites related to a certain hotel, right? This hotel will have this data. We have to give a way to the hotel so they can upload this information. These are unstructured information so that we can consume that information and index that in a way we can answer the users questions. So that means we need a retual augmented generation rag component and that will help us to basically give accurate context answers to the users and their drag will look like this. So hotel owners will basically come and upload their documents, policies or they will point our system to their website and then we will basically fetch those information and our hotel info injection pipeline will as I explained in previous session go through all those information pass it clean it chunk it and then index it and then we will have the index data in the hotel data this the new DB hotel so index hotel data DB and whenever users customers are asking questions about that hotel that specific hotel we can basically fetch information only related to that specific hotel and answer that question and now this is the final architecture. Now we have this new uh there are two new components. One component that will help us to actually do the injection. So that will collect the information from the hotel owners and index that to the DB and then we have the other component that actually go through this database and find answers and our AI agent whenever it want to know about a hotel specific question it just ask a question from our rag. So it's not that I mean it's it's again it's an integration of course but it's a uh kind of very special integration because now we can think of it as this agent is actually asking a question from this guy. It's not actually like it's trying to fetch the data and do it by itself. It's just ask a question and our policy assistant will basically take over that question and find the answers and give a natural language response back to the AI agent. Okay, I think now uh Anjen will take over and basically go through how we can build this using W integrator. Okay, let's welcome Anja. Um yeah, you guys can hear me, right? Nice. Okay, yeah, bad time to drink water. Um so yeah as Nadi hi as Nadish mentioned um so now we have a concrete use case in your guys's head right so in this uh I think we have like 40 yeah 50 minutes left um what we are going to do is we are going to try to build this hands-on right uh if you guys have any questions feel free to interrupt at any time no issues right u so before we get into the actual implementation Um we have to explain the tool that we are going to use to implement this right. So um let me introduce the tool a little bit. So because this tool might be new for some of you guys. Uh so what we will be using is W2 integrator BI. This is the next generation integration product which is um introduced very recently from WSO2. Right. So the idea here is not to uh explain the all the capabilities of W2 integrator but to focus on the AI bits a little and uh as mentioned using that to implement our use case and tell you how to um do the AI transformation in your company like very correctly right so um one of the key features about this product is that we support the seamless transition from low code to pro code and everything in between. So, whatever you write in code, it will be rendered in the diagram. You won't lose anything. It won't be a black box, right? So, we have such features, but again, we're not going to get into those. If you're interested in the product and if you want to get into very um detail about it, if you want more details about it, feel free to talk to us, attend more sessions. There are plenty of sessions on uh BI, right? So, um yeah. Um one more important thing is this is a product which is built in the age of AI right so which mean what what I mean by that is so for a for a product that is releasing right now we have two aspect even in our company strategy we have code for and a for code so we have both aspects here which what I mean by that is as I think malit mentioned um you can develop integrations using natural language age, right? We have that capability and then we have the capability for you guys to build AI applications for your enterprise use cases using BI as well. Right? So that is one of the uh key areas that we are focusing and uh when when it comes to the product development right so um and then yeah uh bit of recap right so as Nadis mentioned earlier back in the day if we let's say I think um like five years ago right if you wanted to let's say I'm I'm a platform like um a booking company right if I wanted to transform my if I wanted to add a add a single AI feature into my product. I had to hire a lot of data science engineers, right? I had to have like entire separate teams. So, you have to have a lot of data. We have to start from data, right? We have to start from data. We have to have a lot of engineers who are data experts, build the models, right? For each feature, you have to build the model, deploy it, right? It's very annoying. Now, now is the time. Now, uh it's more accessible than ever, right? So, now it's there are very capable reasoning models, AI models up up and running in cloud providers. we just have to connect to it. Right? So that that brings me to my next point. Uh so this is becoming slowly but steadily this is becoming an integration problem. Now you don't have to treat it as like a like earlier back in the days it was a separate team's job right now we can use the same integration developers that you already have right and um create this amazing uh AI experiences for your products right so what uh what um WC2 integrator BI specializes in is we have first class abstractions to build these kind of applications and the first class developer tooling because We made this with AI in our mind right so which is what we are going to uh try to focus today and not going to focus too much on the integration aspects of the product but uh at its core it's integration product uh that specializes that specializes in AI right so with that out of the way um so as uh any any programming exercise right let's start with a hello Um, yeah. Okay. This is what I ran earlier. I need to stop this. Um, yeah. So, I already have a Yeah. The hello agent, right? Uh, so this is a you can see the screen there's no it's no issues, right? Yeah. Um, so yeah, this is a empty project completely empty project. I haven't done anything, right? So what we want to do is we want to build a hello agent application right. So all you have to do is you have to go to add artifact right uh just like in any other integration tool you will see like you can make create automations HTTP services right uh file integrations event integrations everything but what I'm interested in here is none of those things right this AI agent part right so if I click that and I say I have to give it a name right I'll just call it creating agent um maybe I'll zoom in a bit. Yeah, sorry. Um, so it's creating the agent. Um, yeah. So, once it's done, you will see this pretty diagram, right, for the agent that we are building. So, as of now, this is like very blank. I agree, right? But, um, if you click on this, you will you can see you can assign a role to this, right? You can give specific instruction on what to do, right? And um various things. And if you click on this icon, you will see you can select the model provider here. What we have is the default model provider from WS2. But we can have open athropic anything, right? So the default just to be clear the default model provider is something that we provide. This is this is a service that we provide to get you started with uh aava features right so this is essentially an open air proxy for now but uh so yeah this is very helpful when you want to get started with with the project and maybe debug right so I'm just going to use defaults I don't want to do anything right so um yeah so I need to execute this particular command to generate the tokens which we require Right. So once that's out of the way, all we have to do is we can click on this chat icon. Right. So and then you can click run integ in integration. So yeah, what this will do is this will run our application and you will see a surprise here in a bit. Right? So I'm going to Yeah. So now you see right we we have this agent chat window up and running in the side. Right. So what we can say is we we can basically ask something right you can say hi right so it'll respond with if I zoom in sorry if I zoom in um uh it replied with hello how can I assist you right so it's this easy for us to create a agent with BI right you don't have to have any tokens if you if you're programming this on your own you have to create rest APIs right uh here the API is already created um you had to create this chat window. You had to have plug it in a front end, right? To check whether the agent is working as you expect, right? So the the if you if you have built agents previously, you will see how much this helps because when we're building agents, it's all about um iterative development, right? We need to see okay, okay, we we need to continue a conversation to see where it goes wrong, how do we refine, right? So this promptdriven development is we we are encouraging that here right. So this is a very simple hello world which is up up and running within like several clicks. So yeah I'm going to stop the uh application for now. Um yeah. So yeah, let me close this and then um give me a second. Yeah. So if we go back to the slide, right? Uh what are we going to build today? Right. So Nadish um already explained um some parts of this as in like the theory part of this right uh but um so what we are focusing on is three main uh components. The first one would be the user activity analyzer which is what we used earlier. Um basically what what Nadis explained earlier right so we have we already have some APIs on his travel the users travel history the reviews that they left right the interest of the user everything in between and so we want to convert that into a LLM friendly personalized profile right so which is what we are going to do with first one and then we have the hotel policy assistant which is what Nadis explained on um the the rag component where you uh you can chat with the policy documents of the hotel, right? And then we have travel plan agent which is the main agent which um is responsible for coordinating everything and answering. Right. All good. Right. Okay. We have to zoom in. Cool. Cool. Okay. Is this better? Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So uh let's get right onto it. Okay. So yeah, so before I start, right, um we already have some applications. So we have the hotel APIs, right? We have admin APIs, we have some external APIs which we are we want to talk to during this process. So we uh I think Nadish again Nadesh mentioned in the first talk we have this platform called Devant which is IP if right. So which contains uh so the devant is a platform where uh you can build integrations, you can deploy integrations, you can um manage it uh test it there right and everything in between. So what uh so I have already uh yeah I have already deployed some of the uh the especially the search API and admin APIs in the devant cloud editor. This is this was released very recently, right? So, uh those APIs are up and running. I'm going to I'm not going to focus on developing those applications because those are already those already exist right in the enterprise. So, um yeah and then u so what again what I'm going to focus is more on the development part. Uh so if we go to our slide right uh what we want to do is um yeah we'll figure out the flow here right so first of all when you're writing an any integration we need to figure out the entry point of the integration right so u this could vary very heavily depending on the enterprise architecture that you guys have at your enterprises but uh so in in this session We are going to mainly focus on simplicity because of the time constraints right. Um but so yeah so in here what we are going to use is automation but this could be either a chron job which can be executed let's say every day right or this could be triggered from an event right so that doesn't really matter but for now what we are going to do is automation. So the flow would be like this. So we want to get for a for a specific user we want to get the um uh the booking history of the user in our platform right uh we we don't want to like we are only using the data from our platforms we are not using anything else but so we know right if if the if the person who if the person went to lots lots of eco-friendly places we know okay this is what this guy likes and if they've been to any the let's say um uh if they prefer like city like places or business class uh places we we can figure it out by by this one right so we know the past reviews that the users left so what we are going to do is we are going to take all this data and aggregate this into a specific format right and then what we are going to do is we are going to send that to the LLM to create the personalized profile right so once everything is done we are going to add it to a database so That's what we are going to do right now. Um, so yeah, again we have somewhat of a empty project here, right? Is it clear? Cool. Um, so as you can see, I have done uh several modifications in advance. Um, first thing is these uh types, right? So if you look at here uh we have this uh thing called record which this record is the structure that uh where we represent data right. So we have a field called booking details which will take this particular for this particular form right and you will see this nice little diagram uh mentioned in the relationship between each record. uh so this is the ultimately we what we want to do is we want to call the APIs and create this particular uh form of data right that's what we we going to do right uh so first of all okay uh I already created the type and um then what we want to do is first of all we need to connect our APIs right the way we do that in BI is by going to connections right from here you will see um lot of all like connectors which we have but the search API the hotel search API or the admin API that's not out there publicly right that's API that we only knows so what we going to do is we are going to add a local connector here uh what we can do is we can give a open API specification right which I have already prepared in advance right so we have the admin API right I'm going to select that open API specification and call this admin API right so what this do is this will create a local connector out of this so that we can access it easily later uh I'm going to do the same thing for a um give me a second for the search API the hotel search API right so I'm going to call it hotel search API cool so now we have two local connectors right now we what I want to do is I want to create a connection to this right so here what I can do is I can click on that and then in configurable so I already configured the URLs and stuff in advance to save time so I'm going to point to the URL that I created right this hotel search API yeah and I'm going to click create uh so as you can see in the diagram we have one connection No, I want another one. Right. So, what I want is admin API and the service URL would be um this one. Yeah. So, yeah. Okay. Now, we have the connections already set up, right? Now, what we want to do is as I explained earlier, I want to talk to these APIs and I want to get the data, aggregate them, right? and create this use activity type. That's what I want to do, right? So what I'm going to do is so we have this feature called BI copilot which is what Malit expla uh introduced early on. Um so what you can do is you can this is a co-pilot for your uh to ease up your developments. Um what you can do is you can say what what needs to be done and and it'll get that done for you. Right? So I already prepared a set of resources so that I can not this one. Yeah. Um yeah. So what I'm going to say is I'm going to say come um oh wait uh I forgot something. Uh so what we need we discussed right what I need is automation. So I'm going to create automation from the project right. So yeah, now I have automation empty automation up and running, right? So what I'm going to say is um I'm going to tell copyright complete the automation to create the user activity based on the previous uh bookings and reviews. I know it's a very abstract uh thing to say, but since we already created the connections and the connectors, it already knows what these APIs are, right? So the ideally co c co-pilot should get it done. So let's wait for some minutes. Um I hope it generates properly. So okay. So this is what I think in previous session if you guys were there what Malit was mentioning. So the latency is a problem right. So the the way we even even for our code generation the latency is a problem. So the way we got beh got around uh with that issue is by streaming right. So then user knows okay this is not stuck right so this is one one concrete examples on what we did um so it's still generating the code right um no no so this copilot is something that uh we provide as in W to provide right what this does is it will generate the code for the user to like to basically If I were to do this manually, right, I have to write the logic to connect to that hotel search API, right? O admin APIs and I had to data map those together, right? That's annoying, right? To to do to do this within like this amount of time. So, what I do is I ask the co-pilot to do that for me, right? So, so it seems like it generated something, right? I'm going to ideally you should review the code it generates but I'm going to trust trust I build and I I'm going to add it to the integration. Uh so and then I'm going to close it. Um so as you can see you you have the the diagram was modified right? So I can maybe uh go into this one and see okay it it fetches some bookings right it talks to admin client API right it gets reviews it does everything so I don't have to write this code now right I I get the co-pilot to do that for me right so um yeah um yeah where okay we were here right so okay I I trust the co-pilot did the job so uh what I'm going to do is I'm going um uh okay now we have the um data structure which we want now what I'm going to do is I'm going to call call the LLM using uh by giving this data right so the way we do that so what we want to do is this is the first pattern that Nadis mentioned we don't want an agent here we don't want a rag here right what we want to say is this is the data of the user right make me a personalized profile that's we that's what we want to do right So uh to do that directly LM call what we are going to do is we are going to use the model providers we are adding a diff again the default model provider as I explained before right so yep um yeah okay we have the connection for that created and then I'm what I'm going to click is generate because this is not a chat operation and here I have to give a prompt right for the LLM to do so this is a prompt where we say Okay, like make me a personalized profile, right? But if you guys have any understanding with playing with prompts, it doesn't work that way, right? We need to be very specific on what we want, the structure that we want and that's how we get a accurate um u response, right? So I already prepared a comprehensive prompt for this uh so that we can build it. Right? So I'm going to copy and paste that. Yep. Uh and the result I would call this llm response. The type I'm expecting is just a simple string. We support data binding as well. But for now we will just um um make a string. Right. So probably you have replaced already, right? Yeah. Yeah. I'll get into that. Uh yeah in the prompt uh thanks Nadish for reminding me that so we have this placehold in the prompt right what we say is we we give like huge prompt saying okay this is so what you have to do this is the categorization and what I want right and then what I say is okay analyze these hotel activities and I point the variable here right so yep and then at this point um so we should have the a generated DLM response and then what I want to do is I want to store this into a database right u so I already have a um database up and running in demand right so and it's it's configured to this integration tool uh so what I'm going to do is uh I'm going to connect to that right so the way we connect to that is we have connections again here right We can select PostSQL. Uh here we can configure it right. So I have the PG host um username. All these are variables which I configured in advance. Right. And the port. Yeah, that should be it. Right. So, okay, looks like our integration is done. Looks like right. Oh, no, it's not done. I I added the connection. Uh, now I want to edit that, right? I need to write a insert query. Um, so again, I'll copy paste the query here. So, okay, the variable name I copied was wrong. Uh I'm going to point to LLM response, right? Which is what I want to insert into the database. Um yeah, so before I execute, let's check the database uh and make sure it's clean, right? Uh so [Music] SQL server databases. Yeah. This is the table that I'm talking about. So the use activity tables, there's no entries here, right? So what I'm going to do is again generate the tokens which are which are required for the LLM. And then what I'm going to do is run this, right? Okay. The moment of truth. Um it's compiling. Okay, seems like it's running now. Um, let's give it a few seconds. Yep. Uh yeah, this is the API response which we got after aggregating. This is the aggregated response uh before we send it to the LLM. Um yeah, seems like it executed without any issues, right? It's automation, right? It's like one and done thing. So what I'll do is I'll refresh this database. See as you can see um we have the for the given user John right we have some uh we have the um personalized profile generated this is based on the u uh format that I asked it to do. So as you can see the hotel type preferences, right? Prefer psychologist, mountain log, resorts, right? Uh and so yeah, travel purpose seems accurate, right? Just like the demo that we did. Um yeah, so this is the sort of uh personalized profile we are going to base base off for now, right? We are going to plug this to the agent later on, but for now, this is our this is our first workflow, right? So yeah and so this is done right and then the second one the second pattern is the rack pattern right so which is what we want to use when we want to um uh the the most common use case is if there's a knowledge base and if we if we want to ask any questions based on that right that's the most common knowledge base for the use case for the rack So what we are going to do is in in in our case the as as we explained earlier it will be the PDF documents which the user has uploaded while the sign by not the users the hotels has uploaded when they sign up for the profile right so again just like any other integration this heavily depends on your enterprise architecture the system right if you have let's say you might have something with um you you might have all the documents which you need which you need in your computer, right? If that's the case, you can perform a bulk upload at a go, right? And then otherwise maybe you have a more sophisticated environment where you have let's say um file server FTP server or something and whenever something gets added there you want to trigger this pipeline, right? So that that's what I said like integration platform is the place to build build these AI applications right now because integration already solves that right integration file integrations those are like bread and butter for us right so um so that's why again I'm saying integration is the way to go here right so so we have several options to do this right one one would be okay we have two two pipelines here one injection second retrieval. Right? So what I'm going to say is so injection either if you have let's say if you have bunch of PDFs or something u what you can do is we have several solutions you don't even have to code in devant what we have is sorry this is the code editor right um in devant you have this injection pipeline uh where you can connect your u vector databases right and then configure embedding models chunking and upload the files is and it'll do the injection for you. Right? This is one path which you can do within like 30 seconds. Right? You don't have to write any code. You don't have to make any integrations. This is very easy. Right? But if you want more customizability, right? If you again if you want to trigger this off of let's say an event like right or um um FTP right then you have to write integration for this right which is uh that is supported by BI as well right. So, I'm not going to build one right now, but I'm going to show you uh something that I built just so that we can um save some time, right? I have 20 minutes. Um so, yeah. So, if you go here, right? So if I show you my file directories, I have this folder called policies. Right? Here I have a bunch of folders which are specific to a given hotel. Right? We have this metadata and we have policies here. For each folder, we have this particular structure. Yeah. Okay. Right. So u again we have the we have the metadata file and the PDF file. Right. So I wrote this integration. I'll just read through the integration. So what we do is again read the read this particular file right and then uh sorry uh what we do is then we have to read this uh policies file right for basically for each file each directory that are there in this directory we're going to read the PDF file metadata file right and then we are going to do something I I don't think this is something that we covered earlier we going to do something called metad database filtering in in future right so the idea there is we are ingesting everything that we have in in this case hotel data, right? We ingesting everything that we have into one index, right? Let's say then it'll contain let's say if if you the the query that we got was um pet policies, right? If you ask about the pet policy, it might give you when you ask about some some uh some specific hotel, it'll it might give you the results from another hotel, right? To prevent that what we are going to do is along with the chunks we are going to append this uh meta data. This can be hotel ID, hotel name right something that you can filter from. So which is why we need the metadata here. But u yeah so we are going to read the PDS convert it to text right and chunk it as N mentioned and then ingest it right. So um yeah uh what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you the so here what I'm using is pine code right um uh yeah as you can see the um there's no records here right so what I'm going to do is again generate the tokens for this project and then run this right so once this is done I should have the chunks inserted into pine cone, right? So, okay, it's executing. Okay, one policy is done, right? Second one also is done, right? So, while it's going, let's see. Oh, see you can see it in real time. So it it uh so you can see the chunks right the you can see the content which is the chunk that we uploading which is which is what we want to um uh which is what's what's useful when we are uh in future when we are retrieving but in addition to that we have the ID and the name as well of the hotel right so this is the injection right um so yeah since this is done I'm going So yeah, this is a sample injection pipeline. Again, this can differ from case to case, right? So, yep. Then what what we have to do is we need to move into the retrieval part. Uh so this policy assistant is what's going to help me with that. Um but yeah so going to I need to update VS code. Um yeah so I already have a base project created again right so what I'm going to do here is so again what we're doing right now is to what we want to do is to retrieve this particular data when someone when a user comes and asks for um uh a policy right so if if they come come in and ask okay what's the pet pet policy of this given hotel uh this is the integration that should be triggered right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a function in BI right which is called let's say query policies right or maybe we can say hotel policies to be more descriptive so there are two parameters that we are going to take the first one would be the type what did I just type yeah uh type would be string and the name would be the question that the user ask right the second One is the hotel ID. There's a reasoning for this, right? As Nadis mentioned, there are in our use case, there are two entry points for this. One would be someone goes to a specific hotel and then selects that. So then you are scoped in right from UX level, you are scoped into that particular hotel. We know the hotel ID then, right? And we want to query about that specific hotel. The second point is this particular this particular rag can be pointed into the main nent. So then it can ask about it has the capability to query uh all the hotels right. So it'll be a bigger part of the bigger bigger story. So what we are going to do is uh we are going to have the hotel ID as input there because of that right. So it can be it can return a simple string or an error right so yep okay we have the again flow up and running here what we need to do is uh the retrieval part right uh let me yeah so I don't want this suggestion so okay the retrieval part so what I'm concerned here is I need to retrieve from the vector database that is how in pine code right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a knowledge base right um from here yeah you have the option of connecting to inmemory vector databases but no I'm going to use pine cone here right the service URL I already configured uh and the API key already configured right so this is done again I'll be using the default embedding provider which is provided by WC2. Thanks. So, yep. Yeah, we have the vector knowledge base created, right? So, and then what we want to do is we want to retrieve now. So, here uh okay, what what would be the query, right? It will be the question that the user ask, right? And then what we want is this metadatabase filtering, right? So I already to save some time I already created uh the filtering function right. So you can pass in hotel ID here. Uh what this do is it'll restrict it to the hotel ID. Basically the it'll apply a filter to uh only search for that uh in in that uh hotel right. So we can create this. Okay. So at this point we have the chunks that we retrieved right now what we want in rag we have retrieval augmented generation right what we want to do is we want to augment the query right so the way we we have a block for that right um we are going to select what we retrieved earlier the question would be users question again right and then we are going to save it right and then what we are going to do is okay Now we agented the query. Now what we have to do is we have to call the LM the generation part. Right? So we already have the model created. I'm going to select chat in this case. Uh we already have the user message which is written by the augmented uh query. I don't need any tools here. Right. So yep. So yeah, now we have the chat response, right? Ultimately, we can simply return this response that we got from the chat um the assistant message, right? And then we can see the content and we know for a fact there will be a response. So we we are going to ensure the time. So yeah, this function is complete. The RA pipeline function is complete. Now it's a matter of plugging this wherever we want. If you want to run this independently, let's say when when you go to the hotel page, we can plug this in. If you want more agentic behavior, uh we call that agentic rag, right? Uh we can plug it to the agent as well, which is what we are going to do here because then we can continue with the flow, right? But it's important to understand this can be a standalone piece without agents as well, right? So yeah uh in agent here uh we can click on this plus button and attach a tool right so in this case it's a function right the function would be query hotel policies so the tool name that I'm going to give uh is uh something like query hotel policies right I that was my function name so I'm I'm going to offend tool part into this. Right? So this description is very important because this gets sent to the LLM. The the tool name and the description is the most important things when it comes to the uh agent to figure out which tools to call. Right? So I'm going to say use this tool uh when you want to query hotel policies, right? Ideally, we have to play around with this a lot, but I'm just going to bring it here. Right. Um, yeah. And also one more thing to notice uh since we haven't compoded the hotel ID here because in this case we are not scoped in right we are scoped out which is like we are in the agent level itself. So uh we are going to provide the hotel ID for now for the function. Uh yeah before this I need to generate the tokens again just to be safe right I'm going to run integration. So this agent should be for now they should only be able to ask uh um policy uh policy related questions right it should be only able to answer the policy related questions right what's the pet policy of the hotel so when I say the hotel it knows because I hardcoded it but yeah um Yeah. So it's the same answer that Nadesh got in the last uh presentation. Right. So if you can see I think I have the PDF which I generated from chat JV on the hypothetical hotel. Uh you'll see where is it? Pet. Yeah we have the information here. Right. So yeah so this is the retrieval pipeline of the rag. Right. So that's also done. We have 10 minutes only. Okay. So let's quickly move on to the agentic um sample as well um which is the main one right u agent right so so this will be the main interface for the user where we in this example whenever they go to the front end this is what we will show u this is the main chat interface that we are going to provide to the user Right. So as of now uh here I already have the tool that I created plugged in. Right. Uh I have tweaked the system message a bit as well. I'll get into that. Uh so okay it's time for us to add the tools. So we need to okay this is the most critical part right. So we need to think okay let's say in the in the previous query right what what they what they are going to say is what the user is going to say is plan me a trip to Sri Lanka for 5 days right but we that's going to that's like the normal user query right people are not going to explain you there like the whole thing right so to answer that efficiently we need to think what are the tools which we need right the first thing to give so first thing is we need to know what are the hotels that we have in our systems, right? We can't let the row l figure that out, right? So, what we want to do is we are going to connect to our search API endpoint. Uh we we going to give access to the search API endpoint as a tool, right? That's the first thing we are going to do, right? So to to again to do that we we need to create a connection for the um uh hotel API. Oops. Yeah. Yes. Data store for uh for rag pipeline. Yes. It's the PDF files that the hotels uploaded when they're signing in. So it depends on the case, right? For the vector database, we are using pine cone as the database, right? So we have se several source of data. Yeah. Um so yep search API. Right. So we're going to call this hotel search API. So we have the hotel search API created and then yeah okay let's go step by step. So okay we have this API. Now what we can do is we can create a connection out of this. Right. We have a connector. We we are creating a connection out of this. Um right the hotel search API. Right. So yep. Um then what we are going to do is we are going to give the access to a specific endpoint as a tool. So we can place press plus. So we are using a connection here right we already created the connection. So we have this this is the endpoint right get hotel search right. So we are just going to plug this in but we have to give a reasonable name. Uh what we're going to say is um uh search hotels tool right we can say always use not sue this tool use this tool uh to get hotel listings of the system right I mean this could be improved so these are the query parameters that that particular end points going to take. I'm just going to tell the LLM to figure it out. Right. Ideally, we should carefully carefully select those. Right. So, have five more minutes. Oh, no. Um, yeah. Okay. So, now this tool has the access to uh know what are the hotels that we have, right? Okay. What else do we need? We need uh user says, \"Okay, plan me a trip.\" Right? We need to know what the user likes, right? We can't just sub suggest something that they don't like, right? So what we want to do is so remember we we stored it to the postquest database, right? We want to connect to that. So what we are going to do is we are going to create a small function to connect to that uh retrieve from that database, right? So what I'm going to say is get from uh person profile. So the parameters would be um could be the use ID right uh and okay um the return type would be string or an error because what we want is the personalized profile, right? We don't need anything else. Just a string is enough. So some some issue with my clicks. Um okay we have the function the new flow here right so what we're going to do is again okay we need to connect to postgress again right so remember these are different projects that I'm switching in between right so what I'm going to do is quickly create a new postgress connection um host something seriously wrong with my clicks Um user password database my lo port. Yeah. So now we have the yeah we have the connection created and then what we going to do is we just want one row right we are just going to query it. So the way we do that is um we just have to do a simple select statement right. So yeah notice this parameter we are sending the use ID uh into the SQL query right. Uh so return type would be uh profile. I'll just call it profile. The return sorry return variable name would be profile. The return type would be string. Right. Um yeah. So that's done. All I had to do is just return um right this profile. That's about it. So yeah, so this function is done right now. Then what I'm going to do is I need to plug this function into the um AI agent, right? So um can see this get from personalized profile right? uh get the tool would be get personaliz profile always. I'm I'm just going to tell the LLM to always use this tool to get information on what the user likes. Right? So that's about it. Uh yeah so the tool is created right so we have two we have three tools now right so then maybe maybe if you want let's say um Nadis talked about MCP servers right let's say if you want to take weather into account while we are planning the itinerary right uh so I already have a so you can see you can connect to that specific MCP server to get that information without coding it here. Right? So I already have uh an MCP server up and running. Right? So what you can do is you can uh select here say weather MCB whatever right and then you can click selected and then you can uh it'll show you all the tools that are there inside of the MCP right uh and then you can select whatever you want right I I'll just select one right so I'm going to save this right so yeah We are bit tight on time. So what I'm going to do is so notice that this doesn't have the capability to for the booking bookings as of now. But uh this should be within this particular set of tools this should be able to generate the itinary for us right uh so let's um test that flow for now right since we are a bit short on time. again configuring tokens and chat. So to if you want to plug the um booking part in, it's just a matter of adding the booking API as a connection and adding it as a tool. Right? So like that it's the flow is the same. It's just it's just a different API, right? So it's compiling Oh, and also I think the code is all always up there on the GitHub. We will share the uh link. You can anyways like try any of these flaws on your own. Um oh, I forgot something. Uh so oh remember I told you that uh the we we support seamless transition from low code to pro code right. So in this one I forgot to configure the MCP server as this particular MCP server only uh supports uh HTTP HTTP 1 right is it here sorry yeah if you look at the HTTP version it's by default it's set to two but uh this particular MCP server only supports HTTP1 that's something that I know because I tried it so you can edit edit it in local code as well or you can edit it in um pro code mode as well. Whatever you do, it doesn't matter. Uh the diagram and the code is always in sync, right? So, okay, it's running. Um I should get the chat window. Okay, here it is. Right. So, we will do our usual query. Plan me a trip for 5 days in Sri Lanka. Right. So it's taking some time. If you look at the Okay, we'll we'll we'll wait for the response and then I'll walk through the verbos logs, right? Uh see, we got the response that we were expecting, right? Uh yeah. So if I walk through the logs just for a minute, it'll be like uh you will see first of all agent agent understands that okay, I need to get personalized profile information. Uh I need to invoke that tool to answer this query right it took it got that yeah see bit clearer I don't need this part now right so yeah the it it invoked the get personalized profile with these parameters right and then um like the the tool responded with this particular long um personalized profile right and then it it it knew okay I need to search the hotels that are available, right? And it did that, right? And remember, see the parameters from the personalized profile. It inferred, okay, I need to go to Sri Lanka, right? And everything like that. And then after that, it got the available hotels, right? And then only it gave the uh trip plan, right? So in our complete implementation, we have the ability to check availability as a separate tools booking uh to perform the bookings as well. But the but you cover the G, right? So it's about adding more and more tools uh to add more capability now right so in here uh yeah so the prompts and stuff some some things I copy pasted because I those are sensitive things that you have to refine and like adjust so I I prepared some things in advance but uh this is the gist it off yeah you can finish it off right okay Cool. Um, we are running out of time maybe. Cool. Cool. So, yeah. So, we spoke about so many things, right? So, to conclude, I think there are some um I'm going to um make this very short. So, we today we implemented very practical use case for a hypothetical organization, right? And try to add some value using the AI features, right? We implemented that within let's say 30 to 40 minutes, right? So we did this using B uh the W integrated BI platform uh uh with the help as well on on the uh editors and um the databases and stuff like that. So yeah, so I think there are few key parts. I think Nadish also covered this before. there are few uh parts that are missing. So here we uh we didn't get even in the demo previously right we didn't get the um authorization from the user before making the booking right that's something that we have to do right which will be covered in the next session right and also we don't want to give the agent too much power too now here we are giving admin we are connecting admin APIs right so we don't want to do that so that's where the agent identification comes into play as well right the governance and everything we need to monitor everything what it does right uh we need to if and when if it goes wrong we need to see okay how did it go wrong we need to calculate the cost uh for that we need governance so next in after lunch there will be a session I think Aisha will do that session uh if you're interested in those make sure to attend that um I think Mhm.

            " So this new video is on video rack retrieval augmented generation over video corpus. Now we all know rag retrieval augmented generation. We put in a query, then it goes and get the retrieval query asking a database. And we get back the retrieve text. And then we construct a full prompt and we get the response note that we have retrieved text here. So instead of text, what this paper is trying to do is give in videos. So retrieved videos versus retrieved text. So this is the innovation. This is the TLDR. If you're interested, let's go through this entire paper. I'm going to go to the most important things that is necessary for putting up the argument. Now we all know rag applications. Now this is an example of a textual rag. For example, how to tie a tie after I cross the white end over the narrow end. Now this is a simple question by the user. And after having received this question, the retriever goes ahead and finds something. So just a normal retriever, which is a textual rag, it goes to Wikipedia and draws out some content, which is not that relevant. And ultimately you get some answer like this, which is not very relevant to the question that we have asked. So this is an example of textual rag. Now conventional multimodal rag, this is where you would get an image and some text as well. So we get a retrieved image of a tie, but that doesn't help to answer this question. So how to tie a tie after I cross the white end over the narrow end. So this question is not answered by this form of retrieval, which is the photo and the text as well. So for example, the answer comes out like this. Nectiles are traditionally worn on top, most short button, fastened and the tie not resting between the color points doesn't help much. Now this is the innovation that you can see here. We see that after we ask this question, it goes ahead and get the video content for you. It goes through the video, it understands the video and brings that particular video along with the subtitles if necessary. And uses that video and the text if there are no subtitles, then this audio is converted to video. Sorry, if there are no subtitles, the audio is converted to subtitles or text. So using the video and the text, we get this answer. So the answer is wrap one white end behind the narrow end, bringing them back to the front of the opposite side. Now you can see the importance of and the benefit of using this video rag. Now let's see one more example before we go into this paper. So this is the example of doing this. So we have explained how to bake cookies on your car dashboard. Now generated answer is I'm sorry, but this is not possible to bake cookies on your car dashboard. The dashboard is not designed for cooking and it is not safe to be used as a heating source. Additionally the fumes from baking could be harmful to your car interiors. So this is what the naive without any rag system would answer. But when we have this video rag, it explains like this, explain how to bake cookies on your car dashboard. It gets the video, it gets the text, it gets the video. So in this case, it gets the video only because that's a video rag V. We will see in just a second and just a minute maybe. So it fetches the video content and using that video, it generates the answer. Now if you look at this answer and compare with the ground truth, you'll see a lot of similarity between the generated answer and the ground throat, which means it is very much useful to have video stored in the vector database and get those videos to answer the question. So let's get started from the start again. Now retrieving external knowledge is very essential in the case of rag applications and we want to incorporate in the generation process. Rag is retrieval on winter generation, largely based on textual information, but they're overlooked largely the video sources, which are a rich source of multimodal knowledge, capable of representing events, processes and contextual details more efficiently than any other modalities. So you've seen it is useful. Now we will convert the videos into textual descriptions as well. They are presenting forward video rag, which is a novel framework that not only dynamically retrieves relevant videos based on their relevance with queries, but also utilizes both the visual and the textual information of videos and the output generation that's interesting. So this is an example of the multimodality richness of the video data. For example, consider the query, how does the expression of the dog change when it is angry? While textual descriptions might describe the dog's barking or crowling, the fail to capture the visual cues or bearing teeth, raised, heckles and narrowed eyes. It's very difficult to describe with text, which are needed for accurate interpreting the emotional state of the dog, as well as formulating the answer to the query. Therefore we have this innovation. We're going to see the results, but the method is that we are presented with the video rag, which performs retrieval of query related videos over video corpus and generate the response grounded in them. This is pretty amazing. Now they have described how the rag is performed. I'm sure you know this or rag retrieves a set of documents or knowledge elements known as K, which is a retrieved documents based on the query. And this K is a subset of the external corpus. So this K is a retriever of the query from the corpus C. So once we have these K items, these K will be used to form the final reply. So why is this? So so so final output is goes to the model. And you can see that it depends on the query and it depends on the K. The model is any LLM that uses the K ordered retrieve contents. So this is the mathematical representation of the retrieval augmented generation. Now let's go to this part or auxiliary text generation. Sometimes not every video in the corpus comes with subtitles. So they propose generating auxiliary textual data by extracting audio from the video and converting it to the text. So both the text and the video will be good. Now the as per the data sets they're using two datasets. First is the wiki how QA and then we have the how to 100 million data set. These are a comprehensive collection of instruction videos sourced from YouTube. Now they have tested with different models, baseline models such as navier text rag. Then we have text rag here DPR and text rag RHE. So video rag which is their contribution. They have made three variants. The first variant uses only text. The video rag T integrates only the transcripts or auxiliary textual data obtained from the retrieve video. So we are talking about videos as well. Video rag. So we're talking about the video corpus. But from that video corpus if we just retrieve the textual format only that model will be called video rag T. If it only utilizes the video frames, then we say it video rag V. And if it jointly utilizes everything we are calling this video rag VT. So these are the three contributions. And then we have the oracle version as well video rag which is the ground truth. So we are giving the actual answer that we are expecting. So this oracle version is your dream version or the original version. Now let's go and see the performance of this. So evaluating the performance we are using this different matrixes. Our rogue L, play O, bird score, G well. And you can see the results here. This is pretty good on the x axis on the on the row wise. You can see that we have different models here on the column wise. We can see the different tests has been done. And you can see that video rag V performs pretty good. It's a best in all these cases. And the second best is video rag VT. We have this and here we have the second best is text video rag. But ultimately we can say that video rag V performs good for all these cases. So this oracle version is our dream version because it is based on the ground truth. So we see that these are the results. So when we use just a visual cues versus when you use a textual cues and when we use everything we use the ensemble, we can see that this performance is pretty good. For different tasks, for example, for an entertaining, we have a rogue L here. And you can see that as we go on increasing from left to right. So naive is performance is less. Then we have text rack performance is better than naive. Then we have the video rag T based on text. It's better than text rack and then we have video rag V. So V is the best. So we have a video corpus and whenever the query comes up, we ask we get the relevant video clips and use that to answer the questions. Now this is one example that you've gone through. Let's go to another examples. This is an example of comparing the text rack and the video rag V approaches. So here explain how to make a clay rose. So retrieve document is this part and the generated answer is this. So the document doesn't provide a step by step guide on how to make a clay one. Okay, we don't have the answer here, but here if you see explain how to make a clay rose, then it fetches the exact video. The video is retrieved. Now using different clips of the video, using different clips from the video, it is used to make the generated answer here and we see that the answer is very close to the ground truth. So what we have seen here is that in this works when we use video corpus and we extract videos when we're using the rag application, this actually improves the accuracy of the rag applications. This is one more contribution to the field of AI. When we say rag, it's not just textual rag, but rag actually depends on different things. It could be audio rag, it could be video rag. This paper is an attempt to see the performance of the video rag and we are very happy with the results. So this brings to the end of the video. Watch out my other videos on my channel. So we have Lama V01 enhanced visual reasoning in LLMs that beats close source models. You can check out this video, else you can go through my channel and check out the other amazing videos that I published. So see you there. Bye bye.\n",

            " So before we go through the session, so let's try to understand what we are trying to cover today. So the topic was like building agents, applications and tools. But why we need to build the application? So we had to first establish a motivation for that. So why we need to build? So we are trying to do AI transformation and we will discuss what is AI transformation and also we will take example and business example and try to use that and say how we can do the AI transformation step by step with that business use case. And then on general basically bringing a episode indicator to say what's all because when we want to implement that in real life, we need the toolkit to develop that. So and then we basically to demonstrate and how we do the AI transformation in the same episode indicator. So this is going to be the story. I don't want to reveal a lot of stuff. That's why I kept it briefed in brief. But now let's try to understand what is the AI transformation. I mean this like, I mean this is not like well adapted term but they are already and people are discussing about this. So the basic idea is now you have a lot of business operations. You have a lot of things that happening in your organization. Now can you use AI and enhance those operations so you will have more productivity, more efficiency or a better use experience and also it can be like unlocking new capabilities that wasn't possible before. And why AI is important in this scenario because AI actually has become very powerful tool with the genitive AI. So now we can build a lot of stuff that we couldn't build before. Previously we couldn't even do a chatbot. Usually unless we have like a lot of tool based or knowledge based kind of systems. Now building a chatbot is just a matter of like writing a prompt. Content to LLM, just have a subscription. Just need to have like five dollars and still you can build chatbot and write it out. You don't even need like lot of money. And why now? And that's all because of that because we have a lot of opportunities now. The new capabilities are there. So you have to basically make use of that and basically transform your business with AI. Otherwise others will do that and you will end up losing the race because the ice race now happening because everybody is trying to use AI so they can transform their business into a better business, better operation. And that's why we need it. It's not a choice of course. Because we have to catch up. I mean even if you don't want to do it, still you will have to do it to catch up with others. Others you can't see why you're not. And then of course how we can do it, right? So which we will actually discuss step by step during this session. So to actually go through this session, we will introduce this business scenario which we call as AI sorry or two travels. There's actually a business or a platform that helps customers to plan their vacations or their trips, right? And then do the reservations like for example the hotel reservations. So with this platform, currently customers can do the hotel discovery and also they can do the availability of the hotels or the rooms real time and also do a reservation. And again basically do I mean write or read reviews so they can get understanding of what they want to basically reserve. So they can do this function. I think you all are family with this. If you are used like booking.com those kind of a platform, this is what actually they do, right? And this is going to be the use experience. We have a static web page where you can basically explore and add certain filters and basically get whatever the available hotels. And this is going to be the experience, right? So this is what we usually have. And this is going to be the architecture we are going to have in our business now. We have a hotel API, search API, booking API, review API and all these APIs are connected to our internal databases where we have the hotel database and we have booking database which we'll connect to the booking API. And also we have bunch of portals that we expose these capabilities to the customers, for example, we have the hotel owners who will try to register their hotels. So they will connect to the registration portal. And that will go through the hotel API and basically we will have that in our DB then. And actually the customers who want to plan their trip, book their trip. If they want to come in, basically do that operation then they have the booking portal. They'll use that. So this is actually a business scenario. We have already, I mean family with, right? So this is what we have right now. And this is going to be our system. And now we have to think how we can apply a transformation onto this existing business APIs. And of course, we should not forget about the data because data is our strategy asset, right? That's the asset actually. So whatever you have, for example, you have the booking system of our customers and we have the search behaviors, we have their reviews, all those things we have already in our hand, right? So we have to make use of that. That's the assist we have. And also we have other information like the hotel information, trends happening, seasonal patterns, also some external data, maybe the weather, events happening, all those stuff, right? So those are also very important information that we can make use of when we are building this kind of, I mean, I didn't say what we are going to build, but it's going to be useful, right? If we have to think of how we can make use of this information because we have AIK buildings that can do that now. Now let's discuss like how we can actually do the a transformation. So before moving to the code, we will try to come with a vision that we want to implement because we can't just get jump to the code, right? That's not the process. So we have to come with a vision where we want to reach. So where we want to reach now with these businesses, we have to have an intelligent, interactive experience that we can give to the users. So they can go and do a trip planning. They can basically say this is my budget, this is what I want, and this is going to be my, basically, the activities that I'm looking for. So those kind of things, they can say to the system and they can get a good trip plan. And then they can basically do the reservations or bookings following that plan. So that kind of experience. And also we have this strategy data, I mentioned earlier. So we want to make use of them and then basically give a better experience to our customers, for example. If you know about their booking patterns or what they like, we can make good suggestions to them, right? That's what actually we are doing in our office. The office of the county application has to make use of what you, what you're interested and when we are trying to use that to use sessions sessions. So you know which sessions that you can attend in a mobile application. And now the key question we can ask here is, can we achieve this transformation without touching the business APIs? So of course, there are two ways. One way is you can basically throw away all the APIs you have and then come up with a set of I mean APIs or system, whatever, integrations. And then consider that as your new experience. But that's too risky because we are still in a domain that there are a lot of unknowns, there are a lot of possibilities. We don't want to just throw away what we have right now. We want to keep it there because even customers are in a transition period. We don't know where the customers will like the, I mean if we have a chat experience, we don't know whether they will like it, right? Maybe they don't like it. They want the all portal. So we don't want to throw away that. We don't want to throw away the existing business. We want to keep it as it is. But on top of that, can we bring our new capabilities? So that's a good question to us if we are actually doing a transformation. And we will kind of showcase like what will be the M product look like? I think Anjana can basically take us through the demo. So we already have a website setup for that. And of course we have logged in. So we know who you are in this city. And this is the current flow we have right now. And we want to improve that. And there is a AI assistant tab on the top. So that's where actually we will give the new experience to our users. So let's go there. And here it will basically explain like what are the capabilities that is available to you because we can't just give a chat and say, okay, do figure it out, right? So it will give some information and then they can start chatting. Other we have to start the backings, right? Yeah. Okay. So this is the agent that we have built. And so that should happen behind the scenes, but we are starting it now. And once we have it, we can try out the capabilities and see like what would the experience look like actually? Okay, we have the chat experience. So let's ask something like planetary. So yeah, I'm not sure the everybody can see. You can maybe zoom it. No, zoom it, zoom it, more, zoom it, zoom it, I think, okay. I know that now the UX is like messed up, but we have to do it for the visibility. Sorry. So let's ask this. So you're asking like plan me a trip to Sri Lanka five day trip and we don't at least five days. So we don't give any other information like what I like because I expect the system to know about those stuff. Now can we just zoom in a little bit because we can see what we have atop? So here in the top is say here we have the five day trip I train for you and it's tailored for your preference. So the guy who were basically asking this question, he has already booked like a lot of eco-friendly hotels in the past and he has basically booked hotel around hiking places. We know in the system we know he's hiking, he loves nature. So we have seen that in his reuse and his booking patterns. So we know those stuff and that information has been fed to the system and now basically it says, okay, this is tailored for your eco-friendly preferences at law for nature, adventure. And that's how basically the system is suggesting us these recommendations like these are the hotels that you can visit and these are the places that you should visit around these hotels. Are the other thing we can do is we can ask like a hotel, specific question, right? Or we can try to book a hotel, but let's try to book a hotel. Yeah. So let's agree with this plan and say okay, go ahead then do the booking. And this is like a kind of a critical operation. Ideally, agents shouldn't do it without any consent or authorization, but now we are doing it because in this session we are not covering that part, but that will be covered in the next session. So in the next session, our speakers will show how we can actually manage these kind of scenarios and get the, I mean, user-authorized, so that agent will not do things that are unwanted. So it has, I think, positive, I don't see actually the responses here. I'm sure the audience can see us. So it's giving us the confirmation number, so it has done, I mean, go ahead with the booking. And it has book two or three hotels, two hotels, right? So, and this is the experience. And also another thing we can try out is we can ask a hotel, specific question. I mean, in our portal, we can't do that. If you want to do that, even with booking.com, if you want to ask a hotel, specific question, you have to go through this contact hotel form, right? So you have to select the contact us. So you have to ask that question and then wait until the hotel agent or whoever, I mean, the human representative from that 10, reach you back. So that's the usual process. But we don't want to do that anymore. We want to be able, the AI to be able to answer those question without any waiting time. So we can ask some question. I'm not sure, okay, but okay, we will ask about the pet policy for a given hotel, one of the hot-tests. That's good. Okay. Now it's giving us answers, saying, okay, Nuckers, wireless launch. They allow pets, small dogs and cats up to seven kilos. Okay, we have to wait till a dog before you're going. And there's a clean if you're okay. Yeah. So of course, so they allow it. So we are good to go, right? Okay. Now so we look at like what's the experience or what's the vision that we have now, right? So now what we need to look at is how we can achieve that vision because we know where we want to go, but we need to figure out how we can reach there. So yes, so we look at the our tip plan, and that was capable doing natural conversations, booking trips, and also small assistants to basically understand your preferences, even without giving that information, and also you were able to ask hotel specific questions. Now there are a set of architecture considerations, right? First, to build this kind of experience, what we need? Do we need a Virginia backflow? Do we need a retrieval augmented generation? If you attended the previous session, we discussed about this concept in detail. Or do we need a agent? So we have to ask these questions and what are the right questions to ask fit to figure this out? Because this is very important. You can't, I mean, if you figure this, you don't figure this out and do something, it's going to be costly for you to roll back. So let's think, okay, can we use a Virginia integration here? Because what we said in our previous session, when we are possible, you have to use Virginia integrations, go and go to the agent because agent will introduce a lot of other problems. So of course, if you give this kind of question, like I want to plan a fighter trip, Virginia, I can basically understand the request and also, generator use for response in, okay, great, based on your preferences. If we have given the preferences, this is what I can recommend. And that's based on whatever the information given to the model or whatever the model knows. And that's all what it can do. It can't go beyond that. It can't get the hotel availability real time. If we haven't provided that information, I mean, we can't give the hotel availability for all the hotel to the prompt, right? That's not practical. We can't, I mean, that Virginia integration cannot actually do actual booking. We just can answer questions, but it can't do that operation. And also, the personalization across the session won't happen, also because now this Virginia integration, it may have access to what we have provided as the personalization, such information, but that's it, right? It can't remember you. The agent can't remember you, but this Virginia integration, it can't. And that's why we need AI agent for this scenario. And because we have to reason and act dynamically, we also have to connect to business APIs like the booking API. And also, we have to leverage the personalization. So we have to basically get a autonomous system, right, to do this thing. So that's why we need AI agent. I think I don't think it's very difficult to determine, but I just wanted to go out to the process. So we can follow that process when you are deciding, I mean, designing other applications as well. So the architecture would look like this. So we have the core business APIs again. They are in the yellow search API, booking API, and we have API. And then we have the tip plan agent, which we are planning to build. And it has to be connected to some user personalization data, which we need to have somehow. And also, it has to connect to the contact hotel. And we will, I mean, because it has to get the hotel specific questions, right, answers to the hotel specific questions. And right now, if we connect it to the contact hotel, that means it's still the agent will have to wait for the human representative to answer back to the contact hotel forum, right, in this scenario. Let's sort it out, stay by state. So we have two components now. The user personalization data and the contact hotel forum. So those are the things that we are having a bit of a trouble now because we don't know we are the user personalization data columns because we have raw data, but we don't have personalization data. And also, we don't want agent to wait until the hotel representative answers. And that means like agent will have to wait and the user will have to wait. So it's not going to solve the problem again. So we have to basically do something for that as well. So we have to use AI to components. So let's first try to figure out how we can do the personalization. So in that case, now we have this tragic data. For example, I explained earlier we have the booking history, we have the search behaviors, we also have the reviews, right, so you have those information. And now can we use that information with genitive AI and transform that information into some personalization reports, personalization profiles that are actually useful to build this scenario. And technically, okay, so the other question we could ask is now earlier case, we decide like we are going to use AI agent, right. So can you use AI agent here also, I mean do we need AI agent really? Technically, I mean we can use AI agent, but we don't know, we so we don't want it, we so overkill. In this scenario, actually we know what we have to build, we know the workflow. So we can do a simple integration. Without AI agent, we can figure it out. So the ideal pattern we would require in this scenario is the genitive AI workflow. And how we would build that is, it's very simple. We will talk to our admin APIs because we can't talk to the users, I mean the whatever the APIs that are used by the user portal, that API is authorized by the users token, right. So user has to basically give authorization to use those APIs, but we have admin portal that can be used by that means to basically look at the reviews or a booking history for a certain user given the user's idea or something. And we can use that API and fish all the booking history and the reviews given by that user. And then use a genitive workflow in the middle. That means that basically you use that information in the genitive AI prompt and then do a generation of a user profile. And that's simple as it is and then you just have to push that to the database. And that profile will look like something like this. So it will have like these are zones activity report and he likes the warm weather, he likes hiking, rock climbing, he likes hot days that have a cough and Lee, gym capabilities and all those stuff and also he doesn't like red so all those preferences that we taken from his previous booking experiences. Okay now when you have the personalization of a system architecture will be extended to this right. So we have the tip plan agent and that try to get the personalization information from the database. And before that is accessing the database we need to have this activity analyze to basically populate the database with all user personalization profiles. Now we are left with the contact us. So how we can solve that problem now. So now we have to think rethink what we should do with the contact hotel forum. So today's problem is like basically I explained it earlier you say has to contact the hotel and then hotel staff will have to basically manually reply back and this is not even our entire staff right this is the hotel staff. So we are not the hotel we are basically the booking.com and we can't do anything to help there until they reply back. So the future vision is like we want a assistant to basically answer this on behalf of the hotel staff and that means users will be more happy because they will get I mean real time or near real time answers and also more consistent responses and how to do this now. That's the I think more more important question. So to do that I think we can see the pattern clear now because we have been discussing these patterns. So we see that we have a lot of data like documents PDF websites related to a certain hotel right this hotel will have this data. We have to give a way to the hotel so they can upload this information this unstructured information so that we can consume that information and index that in a way we can answer the user's questions. So that means we need a pretty well augmented generation rag component and that will help us to basically give accurate context area answers to the users. And that rag will look like this so hotel owners will basically come and upload their documents policies or they will point our system to their website and then we will basically fetch those information and our hotel info injection pipeline will as I explained in previous session go to all those information pass it clean it chunk it and then index it and then we will have the index data in the hotel data this the new DB hotel. So index hotel data DB and when ever users customers are asking questions about that hotel is that specific hotel we can basically fetch information only related to that specific hotel and also that question. And now this is the final log picture now we have this new there are two new components one component that will help us to actually do the injection so that will collect the information from the hotel owners and index that to the DB and then we have the other component that actually go through this database and finances and our AI agent whenever it want to know about hotel specific question it just ask a question from our rag. So it's not I mean it's again it's the integration of course but it's a kind of very special integration because now we can think of this agent is actually asking a question from this guy. It's not actually like it's trying to fetch the data and do it by itself it's just ask a question and our policy assistant will basically take over that question and find the answers and give a natural and a response back to the AI agent. Okay, I think now Angel will take over and basically go through how we can build this using the opposite integrator. Okay, let's welcome Angel. Yeah, you guys can hear me right? Nice. Okay, yeah, bad time to drink water. So yeah, that's not this. That's not this mentioned. So now we have a concrete use case in your guys head, right? So in this I think we have like 40, yeah, 15 minutes left. What we are going to do is we are going to try to build this hands on, right? If you guys have any questions, we do interrupt at any time, no issues, right? So before we get into the actual implementation, we have to explain the tool that we are going to use to implement this, right? So let me introduce that tool a little bit. So because this tool might be new for some of you guys. So what we will be using is W is W is to integrate a BI. This is the next generation integration product, which is introduced very recently from W is to, right? So the idea here is not to explain the all the capabilities of W is to integrate, but to focus on the AI bits a little. And as I mentioned, using that to implement our use case and tell you how to do the AI transformation in your company like very correctly, right? So one of the key features about this product is that we support the seamless transition from low code to pro code and everything in between. So whatever you write in code, it will be rendered in the diagram. You won't lose anything. It won't be a black box, right? So we have such features, but again we are not going to get into those if you are interested in the product and if you want to get into very detail about it, if you want more details about it, feel free to talk to us attend more sessions, there are plenty of sessions on BI, right? So yeah, one more important thing is this is a product which is built in the age of AI, right? So what I mean by that is, so for a product that is releasing right now, we have two aspects. Even in our company strategy, we have code for AI and AI for code. So we have both aspects here, which what I mean by that is, as I think Mollit mentioned, you can develop integrations using natural language, we have that capability and then we have the capability for you guys to build AI applications for you enterprise use cases using BI as well, right? So that is one of the key areas that we are focusing and when it comes to the product development, right? So and then, yeah, bit of free cap, right? So as Nadi's mentioned, earlier back in the day, if we, let's say I think five years ago, right? If you wanted to, let's say I'm a platform like a booking company, right? If I wanted to transform my, if I wanted to add a single layer feature into my product, I had to hire a lot of data science engineers, right? I had to have like entire separate teams, so you have to have a lot of data, we have to start from data, right? We have to start from data, we have a lot of engineers who are data experts, build the models, right? For each feature, you have to build the model, deploy it, right? It's very annoying. Now, now is the time, now it's more accessible than ever, right? So now, there are very capable reasoning models, AI models up and running in Cloud Proidas, we just have to connect to it, right? So that brings me to my next point. So this is becoming slowly, but steadily, this is becoming an integration problem now. You don't have to read this like as, like earlier back in the day, it was a separate team stop, right? Now, we can use the same integration developers that you already have, right? And create these amazing AI experiences for your products, right? So what, what, what WSITO integrator BI specializes in is we have first-class abstractions to build these kind of applications and the first-class developer tooling because we made this with AI now, right? So which is what we are going to try to focus today, and not going to focus too much on the integration aspects of the product, but at its core, it's an integration product that specializes in AI, right? So with that out of the way, so as any, any programming exercise, right? Let's start with the hello world. Yeah, okay, this is what I ran earlier, I need to stop this. Yeah, so I already have the hello agent, right? So this is a, you can see this screen, there's no, should be right? Yeah. So yeah, this is a MTE project, completely MTE project, where I haven't done anything, right? So what we want to do is we want to build a hello agent application, right? So all you have to do is you have to go to add-dart effect, right? Just like in any other integration tool, you will see like you can make create automations, HTTP services, right? File integrations, event integrations, everything, but what I'm interested in here is none of those things, right? This AI agent part, right? So if I click that and I say I had to give it a name, right? I'll just call it creating agent, maybe I'll zoom in a bit, yeah, sorry. So it's creating the agent. Yeah, so once it's done, you will see this pretty diagram, right, for the agent that we are building. So as of now, this is like very blank, I agree, right? But if you click on this, you will, you can see, you can assign a role to this, right? You can give specific instruction on what to do, right? And various things. And if you click on this, I can, you will see you can select the model provider. Here what we have is the default model provider from double-sort to, but we can have open AI, anthropic, anything, right? So the default, just to be clear, the default model provider is something that we provide. This is a service that we provide to get to started with our AI features, right? So this is essentially an open AI proxy for now. But so yeah, this is very helpful when you want to get started with the project and maybe debug, right? So I'm just going to use defaults, I don't want to do anything, right? So yeah, so I need to execute this particular command to generate the tokens which we require, right? So once that's out of the way, all we have to do is we can click on this chart icon, right? So and then you can click run into integration. So yeah, what this will do is this will run on application and you will see a surprise here in a bit, right? So I'm going to, yeah. So now you see, right? We have this agent chat window up and running in the side, right? So what we can say is we can basically ask something, right? You can say hi, right? So it'll respond with if I zoom in, sorry, if I zoom in, it replied with hello, how can I assist you? Right? So it's this easy for us to create a agent with B.A. Right? You don't have to have any tokens. If you're programming this on your own, you have to create REST API, right? Here the API is already created. You have to create this chat window. We have to have plug it in a front end, right? To check whether the agent is working as you expect, right? So the, the, if you, if you have built agents previously, you will see how much this helps because when we are building agents, it's all about, um, iterative development, right? We need to see, okay, wow, okay? We need to continue a conversation to see where it goes strong, how do we refine, right? So this prompt driven development is, we are encouraging that here, right? So this is a very simple hello world, which is up and running within like several clicks. So yeah, I'm going to stop the application for now. Yeah, so yeah, let me close this and then give us again. Yeah, so if we go back to the slide, right, uh, what are we going to build today, right? So, now, now this, um, I already explained, uh, some parts of this, I see, like the theory part of this, right? Uh, but, um, so what we are focusing on is three main components. The first one would be the user activity analyzer, which is what we used earlier, um, basically, what, what now is explained earlier, right? So we have, we already have some APIs on his travel, the user's travel history, the reviews that they left, right? The interest of the user, everything in between. And so we want to convert that into a LLM friendly personalized profile, right? So which is what we are going to do with first one. And then we have the hotel policy assistant, which is what Madhisex explained on, um, the, the rag component where you have, you can chat with the policy documents of the hotel, right? And then we have travel plan agent, which is the main agent, which, um, is responsible for coordinating everything and answering, right? All right. You see, okay. We have the zoom and we have the gears called. Cool, cool. Okay. Is this better? Yeah. So, um, let's get right on to it, okay? So, yeah. So before I start, right? Um, we already have some applications. So we have the hotel APIs, right? We have admin APIs. We have some external APIs, which we are, we want to talk to you in this process. So we, I think, well, now this, again, now this mentioned in the first talk, we have this platform called Devon, which is iFAS, right? So which contains, so the Devon is a platform where, uh, you can build integrations, you can deploy integrations, you can manage it, uh, test it there, right? And everything in between. So what, uh, so I have already, uh, yeah, I have already deployed some of the, uh, the, the, especially the search API and admin APIs in the Devon cloud editor. This is, this was released very recently, right? So, uh, those APIs are pan running. I'm gonna, I'm not gonna focus on developing those applications because those are, only, those are already, they were sell, already exists, right? In the enterprise. So, um, yeah. And then, so what, again, what I'm gonna focus is, moan, the developer part. Uh, so if we go to our slide, right? What we want to do is, um, yeah, we'll figure out the flow here, right? So, first of all, when they are writing any, any integration, we need to figure out the entry point of the integration, right? So, uh, this could vary, very heavily depending on the enterprise architecture that you guys have at your enterprises. But, uh, so in, in this session, we are gonna mainly focus on simplicity because of the time constraints, okay? Um, but so, uh, yeah. So, in here, what we are gonna use is automation, but this could be either a cron job, which can be executed, let's say, every day, right? Oh, this could be a trigger from an event, right? So, that doesn't really matter. But for now, what we are gonna do is automation. So, the flow would be like this. So, we want to get, for a specific user, we want to get the, uh, the booking history of the user in our platform, right? Uh, we don't wanna, like, we are only using the data from our platforms. We are not using anything else, but so we know, right? If the, if the, uh, if the person who, if the person went to lots, lots of eco-friendly places, we know, okay, this is what this guy likes. And if they be into any other, let's say, um, uh, if they prefer like city-like places or business class, uh, places, we know, we can figure it out well by this one, right? So, we know the past reviews that they use as a left. So, what we are gonna do is we are gonna take all this data and aggregate this into a specific format, right? And then what we are gonna do is we are gonna send that to the LLM to create the personalized profile, right? So, once everything is done, we are gonna add data base. So, that's what we are gonna do right now. Um, so, yeah, again, we have somewhat of a empty project here, right? It's a cool thing. Um, so, as you can see, I have done, uh, several modifications in advance. Uh, first thing is these, uh, types, right? So, if you look at here, we have this, uh, thing called record, which this record is the structure that, uh, where we represent data, right? So, we have a field called booking details, which will take this particular form, right? And you will see this nice little diagram, uh, mentioned in the relationship between each record. Uh, so, this is the, ultimately, what we wanna do is we wanna call the APIs and create this particular, uh, form of data, right? That's what we, we gonna do, right? Uh, so, first of all, okay, uh, I already created the types, so, right? And, um, then what we wanna do is first of all, we need to connect our APIs, right? The way we do that in BI is by going to connections, right? From here, you will see, um, lot of all, like, connectors which we have, but the search API, the hotel search API, or the admin API, that's not out there publicly, right? That's the API that we only knows. So, what we gonna do is, we are gonna add a local connector here, uh, but we can do is we can give an open API specification, right? Which I have already prepared in advance, right? So, we have the admin API, right? I'm gonna select that open API specification, and call this admin API. So, what these two is, this will create a local connector out of this, so that we can access it easily later. Uh, I'm gonna do the same thing for a, um, give a second, for the search API, the hotel search API, right? So, I'm gonna call it hotel search API. Cool. So, now we have two local, uh, connectors, right? Now we, what, what I wanna do is, I'm gonna create a connection to this, right? So, here what I can do is, I can click on that, and then, inconfigurable. So, I already configured the URLs and stuff in advance to save time. So, I'm gonna point to the URL that I created, right? This hotel search API, yeah, and I'm gonna click create. Uh, so, as you can see in the diagram, we have one connection now, I'm not another one, right? So, what I want is admin API, and the service URL would be, um, this one, okay? So, yeah, okay. Now we have the connections already set up, right? Now what we wanna do is, as I explained earlier, I wanna talk to these APIs, and I wanna get the data, aggregate them, right? And create this use activity type. That's what I wanna do, right? So, what I'm gonna do is, so we have this feature called BI co-pilot, which is what Malit introduced earlier. So, what you can do is, you can, this is a co-pilot for you to ease up your developments. What you can do is, you can save what needs to be done, and it will get that done for you, right? So, I already prepared a set of resources so that I can not this one, yeah. Yeah. So, what I'm gonna say is, I'm gonna say, come, uh, wait, I forgot something. So, what we need, we discussed, right? What I need is automation. So, I'm gonna create, create automation from the project, right? So, yeah. Now I have automation, empty automation, up and running, right? So, what I'm gonna say is, I'm gonna tell co-pilot, complete the automation to create the use activity based on the previous bookings and reviews. I know it's a very abstract thing to say, but since we already created the connections and the connectors, it already knows what these APIs are, right? So, the ideally co-pilot should get it done. So, let's wait for a few minutes. I hope it generates properly. So, okay. So, this is what I think in previous session, if you guys were there, what Malit was mentioning. So, the latency is a problem, right? So, the way we, even, even for our code generation, the latency is a problem. So, the way we got around, that issue is by streaming, right? So, then user knows, okay, this is not stuck, right? So, this is one concrete example, so on what we did. So, it's still generating the code, right? This is, is the API and not the use to do certain things? No, no. So, this co-pilot is something that we provide, as in WSWT provide, right? What this does is, it will generate the code for the user to, like, to, basically, if I were to do this manually, right? I have to write the logic to connect to that hotel search API, right? Oh, oh, admin API's and I had to data map those together, right? That's annoying, right? To do this, within like this amount of time. So, what I do is, I ask the co-pilot to do that for me, so it seems like it generated something, right? I'm going to, ideally, you should review the code it generates, but I'm going to trust or I will, then I'm going to add it to the integration. So, and then I'm going to close it. So, as you can see, you have the diagram was modified, right? So, I can maybe go into this one and see, okay, it features some bookings, right? It talks to admin client API, right? It gets reviews. It does everything. So, I don't have to write this code now, right? I get the co-pilot to do it that for me, right? So, yeah, yeah, okay, we were here, right? So, okay, I trust the co-pilot did the job, so what I'm going to do is, I'm going to, okay, now we have the data structure that which we want, now what I'm going to do is, I'm going to call the LLM using by giving this data, right? So, the way we do that, so what we want to do is, this is the first pattern that Nathis mentioned. We don't want an agent here, we don't want to drag here, right? What we want to say is, this is the date of the user, right? Make me a personalized profile, that's what we want to do, right? So, to do that directly LLM, what we are going to do is, we are going to use the model providers, we are adding a, again, the default model providers I explained before, right? So, yeah, yeah, we have the connection for that created and then what I'm going to click is generate, because this is not a chat operation, and here I have to give a prompt, right, for the LLM to do, so this is a prompt where we say, okay, like make me a personalized profile, right? But if you guys have any understanding with playing with prompts, it doesn't work that way, right? We need to be very specific on what we want, the structure that we want, and that's how we get a accurate response, right? So, I already prepared a comprehensive prompt for this, so that we can build it, right? So, I'm going to copy and paste that, yep, and the result I would call this LLM response, the type I'm expecting is just a simple string, we support data binding as well, but for now, we will just make a string, right? So, yeah, yeah, I'll get into that, yeah, in the prompt, thanks, not a show, remember me that, so we have this place in the prompt, right? What we say is, we give like huge prompt saying, okay, this is what you had to do, this is the categorization and what I want, right? And then what I say is, okay, analyze this, what I'll activate is, and I point the variable here, right? So, yep, and then at this point, so we should have the generated LLM response, and then what I want to do is, I want to store this into a database, right? So, I already have a database up and running in Devon, right? So, it's configured to this integration tool, so what I'm going to do is, I'm going to connect to that, right? So, the way we connect to that is, we have connections again here, right? We can select post-rescue well, here we can configure it, right? So, I have the phghost, use a name, all these are variables, which I configured in advance, right? And the port, yeah, that should be it, right? So, okay, looks like our integration is done, looks like, right? Oh no, it's not done. I added the connection, now I want to edit, right? I need to write an inside query. So, again, I'll copy-based the query here. So, okay, the variable name my copy was wrong, I'm going to point to LLM response, right? Which is what I want to insert into the database. Yeah, so, before I execute, let's check the database, and make sure it's clean, right? So, SQL, same on databases, yeah. This is the table that I'm talking about. So, the use activity tables, there's no interest here, right? So, what I'm going to do is, again, generate the tokens, which are required for the LLM, and then what I'm going to do is run this, right? Okay, the moment of truth. It's compiling. Okay, seems like it's running now. Let's give it a few seconds. Yep. Yeah, this is the API response, which we got after aggregating, this is the aggregated response before we send it to the LLM. Yeah, seems like it takes security without any issues, right? It's automation, right? It's like one and done thing. So, what I'll do is, I'll refresh this database. See, as you can see, we have the, for the given user zone, right? We have some, we have the personalized profile generated. This is based on the format that I asked it to do. So, as you can see, the hotel type preference, right? Prefer, psychologist, mountainologist, resource, right? And so, yeah, travel per person seems secure, right? Just like the demo that we did. Yeah, so this is the sort of personalized profile, we are going to base, base of for now, right? We are going to plug this to the agent later on, but for now, this is stuff, this is our first workflow, right? So, yeah. And so, this is done, right? And then the second one, the second pattern is the rack pattern, right? So, which is what we want to use when we want to, the most common use cases, if there's a knowledge base, and if we want to ask any questions based on that, right? That's the most common knowledge base for the use case for the rack. So, what we are going to do is, in our case, as we explained earlier, it will be the PDF documents which the user has uploaded while they are not the uses, the hotels have uploaded when they are signed up for the profile, right? So, again, just like any other integration, this heavily depends on your enterprise architecture, the system, right? If you have, let's say, if you might have something with, you might have all the documents which you which you need in your computer, right? If that's the case, you can perform a bulk upload at a go, right? And then otherwise, maybe you have a more sophisticated environment where you have, let's say, file server, FTP server or something. And whenever something gets added there, you want to trigger this pipeline, right? So, that's what I said, like, integration platform means the place to build this AI applications right now because integration already solves that, event integration, file integrations, those are like bread and butter butter for us, right? So, so that's why, again, I'm saying integration is the way to go here, right? So, so we have several options to do this, right? One would be, okay, we have two, two pipelines here, one injition, second retrieval, right? So, what I'm going to say is, so injition, either if you have, let's say, if you have a bunch of PDFs or something, what you can do is we have several solutions, you don't even have to code in Devant, what we have is, sorry, this is the code editor, right? In Devant, you have this injition pipeline, where you can connect your vector databases, right? And then configure embedding models, chunking, and upload the files, and it will do the ingestion for you, right? This is one part, which you can do within like 30 seconds, right? You don't have to write any code, you don't have to make any integrations, this is very easy, right? But if you want more custom visibility, right? If you, again, if you want to trigger this off-over, let's say an event, right? Or FTP, right? Then you have to write an integration for this, right? Which is, that is supported by BIS, right? So, I'm not going to build one right now, but I'm going to show you something that I built, just so that we can save some time, right? I have 20 minutes. So, yeah. So, if you go here, right? So, if I show you my file directories, I have this folder called policies, right? Here, I have a bunch of folders, which are specific to a given hotel, right? We have this metadata and we have policies here. For each folder, we have this particular structure, yeah. Okay, right? So, again, we have the, we have the metadata file and the PDF file, so I wrote this integration, I'll just read through the integration. So, what we do is, again, read this particular file, right? And then, sorry, what we do is, then we have to read this policies file, right? Basically, for each file, each directory that are there in this directory, we are going to read the PDF file, metadata file, right? And then we are going to do something, I don't think this is something that we covered earlier. We are going to do something called meta database filtering in future, right? So, the idea there is, we are ingesting everything that we have in this case hotel data, right? We are ingesting everything that we have into one index, right? Let's say, then it will contain, let's say, if it is, the query that we got was, pet policies, right? If you ask about the pet policy, it might give you, when you ask about some specific hotel, it might give you the results from another hotel, right? To prevent that, what we are going to do is, along with the chunks, we are going to append this metadata. This can be hotel ID, hotel name, right? Something that you can filter from. So, which is why we need the metadata here? But, yeah, so we are going to read the PDFs, convert it to text, right? And chunk it, as now this mention, and then ingest it, right? So, yeah, what I am going to do is, I am going to show you the, so here what I am using is pinecone, right? As you can see, there is no records here, right? So, what I am going to do is, again, generate the tokens for this project, and then run this, right? So, once this is done, I should have the chunks inserted into pinecone, right? So, okay, security, okay? One policy is done, right? Second one also is done, right? So, while it's going, let's see, see, you can see it in real time. So, it, it, so you can see the chunks, right? There, you can see the content, which is the chunk that we are uploading, which is, which is what we want to, which is what's useful when we are, in future when we are retrieving, but in addition to that, we have the ID and the name as well of the hotel, right? So, this is the ingestion, right? So, yeah, this is done, I am going to, so yeah, this is sample ingestion pipeline, again, this can differ from case to case, right? So, yeah, then what we have to do is, we need to move into the retrieval part. So, this policy assistant is what's going to help me with that, but yeah, so I need to update VSCode, yeah. So, I already have a base project created again, right? So, what I am going to do here is, so again, what we are doing right now is to, what we want to do is to retrieve these particular data when someone, when a user comes and asks for a policy, right? So, if they come in and ask, what's the pet policy of this given hotel? This is the integration that should be triggered, right? So, what I am going to do is, I am going to create a function in BI, right? Which is called, it is a query policies, right? Or maybe we can say, hotel policies to be more descriptive. So, there are two parameters that we are going to take, the first one would be the type, or the type, or the type, or type, or type, yeah. Type would be string and the name would be the question that they use ask, right? The second one is the hotel ID, that's a reasoning for this, right? As Nadi's mentioned, there are, in our use case, there are two entry points for this. One would be someone goes to a specific hotel and then selects that, so then you are scoped in, right? From UX level, you are scoped into that particular hotel, we know the hotel ID then, right? And we want to query about that specific hotel. The second point is, this particular, this particular rag can be pointed into the main agent. So, then it can ask about, it has the capability to query all the hotels, right? So, it will be a bigger part of the bigger, bigger story. So, what we are going to do is, we are going to have the hotel ID as input there, because of that, right? So, it can be, it can return a simple string over an error, right? So, yep, okay, we have the, again, flow of pen running. Here, what we need to do is, the retrieval part, right? Let me, yeah, so, I don't want this suggestion, so, okay, the retrieval part. So, what I am concerned here is, I need to retrieve from the vector database, that is, out there in Pinecon, right? So, what I am going to do is, I am going to create a knowledge base, from here, yeah, we have the option of collecting to in memory vector databases, but, no, I am going to use Pinecon here, right? The service URL, I already configured, and the API key, already configured, right? So, this is done. Again, I will be using the default embedding provider, which is provided by WSitu, thanks. So, yep, yeah, we have the vector knowledge base created, right? So, and then what we want to do is, we want to retrieve now. So, here, okay, what would be the query, right? It will be the question that the user asks, right? And then what we want is, this metadata base filtering, right? So, I already to save some time, I already created the filtering function, right? So, you can pass in hotel ID here. What these two is, it will restrict it to the hotel ID, basically, that it will apply a filter to only search for that in that hotel, right? So, we can create this. Okay, so at this point, we have the chunks that we retrieved, right? Now, what we want in a rack, we have retrieval of mental generation, right? What we are going to do is, we want to augment the query, right? So, the way we have blocked for that, right? We are going to select what we retrieved earlier. The question would be, user's question again, right? And then, we are going to save it, right? And then, what we are going to do is, okay, now we have bent at the query, now what we have to do is, we have to call the generation path, right? So, we already have the model created, I am going to select chat in this case. We already have the user message, which is written by the augmented query. I don't need any tools here, right? So, yeah. So, yeah, now we have the chat response, right? Ultimately, we can simply return this response that we got from the chat, the assistant message, right? And then, we can see that content, and we know for a fact there will be a response. So, we are going to end to the time. So, yeah, this function is complete, the right pipeline function is complete. Now, it is a matter of plugging this wherever we want. If you want to run this independently, let's say when you go to the hotel page, we can plug this in. If you want more agent behavior, we call that agentic rig, right? We can plug it to the agent as well, which is what we are going to do here, because then we can continue with the flow, right? But it is important to understand, this can be a standalone piece without agents as well, right? So, yeah. In agent here, we can click on this plus button and attach a tool, right? So, in this case, it is a function, right? The function would be query hotel policies. So, the tool name that I am going to give is something like query hotel policies, right? That was my answer name, so I am going to offend tool part into that, right? So, this description is very important, because this gets sent to the LLM, the tool name and the description is the most important things when it comes with the agent to figure out which tools to call, right? So, I am going to say, use this tool when you want to query hotel policies, right? Ideally, we had to play around with this a lot, but I am just going to bring it here, right? And also, one more thing to notice, since we haven't come, so in this stage, I have hard coded the hotel ID here, because in this case, we are not scoped in, right? We are scoped out, which is like, we are in the agent level itself. So, we are going to provide the hotel ID for now, for the function, before this, I need to generate the tokens again, just to be safe, right? I am going to run integration. So, this agent should be, for now, they should only be able to ask policy-related questions, right? Or it should be only able to answer the policy-related questions, right? What is the paid policy of the hotel? So, when I say the hotel, it knows because I hard coded it, but yeah. Yeah, so it is the same answer that now this got in the last presentation, right? So, if you can see, I think I have the PDF, which I generated from ChatGee video on the hypothetical hotel, you will see, there is it, bit, yeah, we have the information here, right? So, yeah, so this is the retrieval pipeline of the rank, right? So, that's also done, we have 10 minutes only, okay? So, let's quickly move into the agent sample as well, which is the main one, right? Agent, right? So, so this will be the main interface for the user, where we, in this example, whenever they go to the front end, this is what we will show, this is the main Chat interface that we are going to provide to the user, right? So, as of now, here I already have the tool that I created plugged in, right? I have to make the system message a bit as well, I will get into that. So, okay, it's time for us to add the tools, so we need to, okay, this is the most critical part, right? So, we need to think, okay, let's say in the in the previous query, right? What they, what they are going to say is, what the user is going to say is, plan me a trip to Sri Lanka for five days, right? But that's going to, that's like the normal user query, right? People are not going to explain you, they are like the whole thing, right? So, to answer that efficiently, we need to think, what are the tools which we need, right? The first thing to give, so first thing is we need to know, what are the hotels that we have in our systems, right? We can't let the row LL figure that out, right? So, what we want to do is, we are going to connect to our search API endpoint, we are going to give access to the search API endpoint as a tool, right? That's the first thing we are going to do, right? So, to, again, to do that, we need to create a connection for the hotel API. Yes. Yes. Data store. Data store. For, for rank pipeline? Yes, it's the PDF files that the hotel's uploaded when they're signing in. So, it depends on the case, right? For the vector database, we are using fine call as the database, right? So, we have several social data, right? So, yep, search API, right? So, we are going to call this hotel search API. So, we have the hotel search API created and then, yeah, okay, let's go step by step. So, we have this API now, what we can do is, we can create a connection out of this, right? We have a connector, we are creating a connection out of this, right? The hotels are SAP. So, yep, then what we are going to do is, we are going to give the access to a specific endpoint as a tool. So, we can place the press plus. So, we are using a connection here, right? We already created the connection. So, we have, this is the endpoint, right? Get a hotel search, so we are just going to plug this in. But, we have to give a reasonable name. What we are going to say is search hotel's tool, right? We can say, always use not so this tool. Use this tool to get hotel listings of the system, right? I mean, this could be an improved. So, these are the query parameters that particular endpoint is going to take. I am just going to tell the LLM to figure it out, right? Ideally, we should carefully see like those, right? So, yeah, five minutes, oh no. Yeah, okay. So, now this tool has the access to know what are the hotels that we have, right? Okay, what else do we need? We need, users say, okay, plan mean a trip, right? We need to know what the user likes, right? We can't just, such as something that they don't like, right? So, what we want to do is, so remember we, we stored it to the Postgres database, right? We want to connect to them. So, what we are going to do is, we are going to create a small function to connect to that retrieve from that database, right? So, what I am going to say is get from the profile. So, the parameters would be, it will be the use ID, right? And, okay, the return type would be string over an error because what we want is the personalized profile, right? We don't need anything else just a string is enough. So, some, some issue with my flicks, okay. We have the new flow here, right? So, what we are going to do is again, okay, we need to connect to Postgres again, right? So, remember these are different projects that I am switching in between, right? So, what I am going to do is quickly create a new Postgres connection, host, something seriously wrong with my flicks user, password, database, yeah? So, now we have the, yeah, we have the connection created and then what we are going to do is, we just want one row, right? We are just going to create. So, the way we do that is, we just have to do a simple select statement, right? So, yeah, notice this parameter, we are sending the use ID into the SQL query, right? So, return type would be profile, I will just call it profile, the return, sorry, return variable name would be profile, the return type would be string, right? Yeah, so that's done, all I have to do is just return, right? It's profile, that's about it. So, yeah, so this function is done, right? Now, then what I am going to do is, I need to plug this function into the AI agent, right? So, can see this gets get from pass and like profile, right? The tool would be get pass and profile always, I am just going to tell the LLM to always use this tool to get information on what the use likes, right? So, that's about it. Yeah, so the tool is created, right? So, we have two, we have three tools now, right? So, then maybe, maybe if we want, let's say, another talked about MCP servers, right? Let's say, if you want to take with the into account while we are planning the itinerary, right? So, I already have a, so you can see, you can connect to that specific MCP server to get that information without coding it here, right? So, I already have an MCP server pen running, right? So, what you can do is you can select here, say, whether MCP, whatever, right? And then you can click selected and then you can, it will show you all the tools that are there inside of MCP, right? And then you can select whatever you want, right? I'll just select one, right? So, I am going to save this, right? So, yeah, we are bit tight on time, so what I am going to do is, so notice that this doesn't have the capability for the booking, booking as of now, but this should be within this particular set of tools, this should be able to generate the itinerary for us, right? So, let's test that flow for now, right? Since we are bit short on time, again, config token and chat. So, if you want to plug the booking part in, it's system matter of adding the booking API as a connection and adding it as a tool, right? So, like that, the flow is the same, it's just different API, okay? So, it's compiling. Oh, and also I think the code is always up there on the GitHub, we will share that link. You can anyway, like, try any of these flows on your own. Oh, I forgot something. So, remember, I told you that the, we support seamless transfer from low code to pro code, right? So, in this one, I forgot to configure the MCP service, this particular MCP service only supports HTTP, HTTP1, right? Sit here, don't here, sorry. Yeah, if you look at the HTTP version, it's by default it's set to two, but this particular MCP service only supports HTTP1, that's something that I know because I tried it. So, you can edit it in low code as well. Oh, you can edit it in pro code, whatever you do, it doesn't matter. The diagram and the code is always in sync, right? So, okay, it's running. I should get this at window, okay, here it is, right? So, we will do our usual query, plan me a trip for five days in Sri Lanka, right? So, in some time, you look at the, okay, we will wait for the response and then I'll walk through the verbose logs, right? See, we got the response that we were expecting, right? Yeah, so if I walk through the logs just for a minute, it will be like, you will see, first of all, agent understands that, okay, I need to get personalized profile information, I need to invoke that tool to answer this query, right? It got that, yeah, see, it clear, I don't need this partner, right? So, yeah, the it it it it invoked the get personalized profile with these parameters, right? And then the tool responded with this particular long personalized profile, right? And then it it it knew, okay, I need to search the hotels that are available, right? And it did that, right? And remember, see the parameters from the personalized profile, it inferred, okay, I need to go to Sri Lanka, right? And everything like that. And then after that, it got the available hotels, right? And then only it gave the trip plan, right? So, in our complete implementation, we have the ability to check availability as a separate tools, booking to perform the bookings as well. But the but you cover this, right? So, it's about adding more and more tools to add more capability now, right? So, in here, yeah, so the from send stuff, some some things I copy pasted because I those are sensitive things that you have to refine and like adjust. So, I I prepared some things in advance, but this is the gist. Now, this is the right answer. Yeah? Okay. Okay. So, yeah. So, we spoke about so many things, right? So, to conclude, I think there are some, I'm going to make this very short. So, we today we implemented the very practical use case for a hypothetical organization, and tried to add some value using the AI features, right? We implemented that within, let's say, 30 to 40 minutes, right? So, we did this using the WSR integrated BI platform, with the one cell pass well on the editors and the databases and stuff like that. So, yeah. So, I think there are few key parts, I think Nadi also covered this before. There are few parts that are missing. So, here we didn't get even in the demo previously, right? We didn't get the authorization from the user before making the booking, right? That's something that we have to do, which will be covered in the next session, right? And also, we don't want to give the agent too much power to now here we are giving admin, we are connecting admin APIs, right? So, we don't want to do that. So, that's where the agent identification comes into play as well, right? The governance and everything. We need to monitor everything what it does, right? We need to, if and when if it goes wrong, we need to see, okay, how do you go wrong? We need to calculate the cost for that we need governance. So, in after lunch, there will be a session, I think, I shall do that session. If you are interested in those, make sure to attend that.\n",

            " So this new video is on video rack retrieval augmented generation over video corpus. Now we all know rag retrieval augmented generation. We put in a query, then it goes and get the retrieval query asking a database and we get back the retrieve text and then we construct a full prompt and we get the response note that we have retrieve text here. So instead of text, what this paper is trying to do is give in videos, so retrieved videos versus retrieved text. So this is the innovation, this is the TLDR. If you're interested, let's go through this entire paper. I'm going to go to the most important things that is necessary for putting up the argument. Now we all know rag applications. Now this is an example of a textual rag, for example, how to tie a tie after I cross the white end over the narrow end. Now this is a simple question by the user and after having received this question, the retriever goes ahead and finds something. So just a normal retriever, which is a textual rag, it goes to Wikipedia and draws out some contents which is not that relevant and ultimately you get some answer like this, which is not very relevant to the question that we have asked. So this is an example of textual rag. Now conventional multimodal rag, this is where you would get an image and some text as well. So we get a retrieved image of a tie but that doesn't help to answer this question. So how to tie a tie after I cross the white end over the narrow end. So this question is not answered by this form of retrieval, which is the photo and the text as well. So for example, the answer comes out like this. Next I said traditionally worn on top, shirt button, fastened and the tie not resting between the color points doesn't help much. Now this is the innovation that you can see here. We see that after we asked this question, it goes ahead and get the video content for you. It goes through the video, it understands the video and brings that particular video along with the subtitles if necessary. And uses that video and the text if there are no subtitles that is audio is converted to video, sorry, if there are no subtitles, the audio is converted to subtitles or text. So using the video and the text, we get this answer. So the answer is wrap one white end behind the narrow end, bringing them back to the front of the opposite side. Now you can see the importance of and the benefit of using this video rag. Now let's see one more example before we go into this paper. So this is the example of doing this. So we have explained how to bake cookies on your car dashboard. Now generated answer is I'm sorry, but this is not possible to bake cookies on your car dashboard. The dashboard is not designed for cooking and it is not safe to be used as a heating source. Additionally the fumes from baking could be harmful to your car interiors. So this is what the naive without any rag system would answer. But when we have this video rag, it explains like this explain how to bake cookies on your car dashboard. It gets the video gets the video it gets the text it gets the video. So in this case it gets the video only because that's a video rag V. We will see in just a second and just a minute maybe. So it fetches the video content and using that video it generates the answer. Now if you look at this answer and compare with the ground truth, you'll see a lot of similarity between the generated answer and the ground throat, which means it is very much useful to have video stored in the vector database and get those videos to answer the question. So let's get started from the start again. Now retrieving external knowledge is very essential in the case of rag applications and we want to incorporate in the generation process. Rag is retrieval on winter generation largely based on textual information, but they're overlook largely the video sources, which are a rich source of multimodal knowledge capable of representing events, processes and contextual details more efficiently than any other modalities. So you've seen it is useful. Now we will convert the videos into textual descriptions as well. They are presenting forward video rag, which is a novel framework that not only dynamically retrieves relevant videos based on their relevance with queries, but also utilizes both the visual and the textual information of videos and the output generation that's interesting. So this is an example of the multimodality richness of the video data. For example, consider the query, how does the expression of the dog change when it is angry? While textual descriptions might describe the dog's barking or crowling, the fail to capture the visual cues or bearing teeth, raised, heckles and narrowed eyes. It's very difficult to describe with text, which are needed for accurate interpreting the emotional state of the dog, as well as formulating the answer to the query. Therefore we have this innovation. We're going to see the results, but the method is that we are presented with the video rag, which performs retrieval of query related videos over video corpus and generate the response grounded in them. This is pretty amazing. Now this, they have described how the rag,\n",

            " is performed. I'm sure you know this. So rag retrieves a set of documents or knowledge elements known as K, which is a retrieve documents based on the query. And this K is a subset of the external corpus. So this K is a retriever of the query from the corpus C. So once we have these K items, these K will be used to form the the final reply. So why is this also so final output is goes to the model. And you can see that it depends on the query and it depends on the K. The model is any LLM that uses the K audit retrieve contents. So this is the mathematical representation of the retrieval augmented generation. Now let's go to this part or auxiliary text generation. Sometimes not every video in the corpus comes with subtitles. So they propose generating auxiliary textual data by extracting audio from the video and converting it to the text. So both the text and the video will be good. Now the as per the data sets, they're using two data sets. First is the wiki how QA and then we have the how to 100 million data set. These are a comprehensive collection of instruction videos sourced from YouTube. Now they have tested with different models, baseline models such as naive here, text rag, then we have text rag here, DPR and text rag RHE. So video rag, which is their contribution, they have made three variants. The first variant uses only text. So video rag T integrates only the transcripts or auxiliary textual data obtained from the retrieve video. So we are talking about videos as well. Video rag. So we're talking about the video corpus, but from that video corpus, if we just retrieve the textual format only that model will be called video rag T. If it only utilizes the video frames, then we say it video rag V. And if it jointly utilizes everything, we are calling this video rag VT. So these are the three contributions. And then we have the Oracle version as well video rag, which is the ground truth. So we are giving the actual answer that we are expecting. So this Oracle version is your dream version or the original version. Now let's go and see the performance of this. So evaluating the performance we are using this different matrixes are rogue L, blau, bird score, G well, and I can see the results here. This is pretty good on the x axis on the on the row wise. You can see that we have different models here on the column wise. We can see the different tests has been done. And you can see that video rag V performs pretty good. It's a best in all these cases. And the second best is video rag VT. We have this. And here we have the second best as text video rag. But ultimately we can say that video rag V performs good for all these cases. So this Oracle version is our dream version because it is based on the ground truth. Okay. So we see that these are the results. So when we use just a visual cues versus when you use a textual cues and when we use everything we use the ensemble, we can see that this performance is pretty good for different tasks. For example, food and entertain entertaining. We have a rogue L here. And you can see that as we go on increasing from left to right. So naive is performance is less than we have text rack performance is better than naive. Then we have the video rag T based on text. It's better than text rack. And then we have video rag V. So V is the best. So we have a video corpus. And whenever the query comes up, we ask we get the relevant video clips and use that to answer the questions. Now this is one example that you've gone through. Let's go to another examples. This is an example of comparing the text rack and the video rag V approaches. So here explain how to make a clear rose. So retrieve document is this part and the generated answer is this. So the document doesn't provide a step by step guide on how to make a clear one. Okay, we don't have the answer here. But here if you see explain how to make a clear rose, then it fetches the exact video. The video is retrieved. Now using different clips of the video using different clips from the video, it is used to make the generated answer here. And we see that the answer is very close to the ground truth. So what we have seen here is that in this works when we use video corpus and we extract videos. When we using the rag application, this actually improves the accuracy of the rag applications. Now this is one more contribution to the field of AI. When we say rag, it's not just textual rag, but rag actually depends on different things. It could be audio rag, it could be video rag. This paper is an attempt to see the performance of the video rag and we are very happy with the results. So this brings to the end of the video, watch out my other videos on my channel. So we have Lama V01 enhanced visual reasoning in LLMs that beats close source models. You can check out this video, else you can go through my channel and check out the other amazing videos that I published. So see you there. Bye bye.\n",
